SECOND SEMESTER 2020-21
COURSE HANDOUT

 

Date: 18.01.2021

In addition to part I (General Handout for all courses appended to the Time table) this portion gives further
specific details regarding the course.

Course No : CHE F342
Course Title : Process Dynamics and C ontrol
Instructor-in-C harge : HARE KRISHNA MOHANTA

Instructor(s) (Tut/Prac) : Srinivas A ppari, Venkata Vijayan S

1. Course Description:

Dynamic modeling and simulation of momentum, energy, mass transfer and reacting systems; analysis of the
dynamic behaviour of lumped and distributed parameter systems; analysis and design of simple feedback and
advanced control systems; design of control systems with multiple input and multiple output; introduction to
computer control.

2. Scope and Objective of the C ourse:

This course deals with the design of the control systems for chemical processes, not as a mathematical
problem, but as an engineering task with all its attractive challenges and practical shortcomings using the
fundamental concepts of process dynamics as the basis. The course aims to help the student in the selection
of the best among the several alternative control configurations usually possible for a given processing unit or
a complete plant. Finally the course will familiarize the student with a plethora of analytical tools and design
methodologies to be understood before attempting the process control problems.
