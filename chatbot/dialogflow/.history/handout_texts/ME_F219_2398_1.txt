Course No >: ME F219

Course Title : MANUFACTURING PROCESSES

Instructor-in-C harge : TUFAN CHANDRA BERA

Tutorial Instructors : Divyansh Patel, Tufan Chandra Bera, Faizan Mohammad Rashid

Practical Instructors : Rishi Kumar, Anish Kumar, Rishi Parvanda, Pawar Shrikant
Shankarrao

1. Course Description:

Metal casting, different types of casting processes, casting analysis and defects. Metal forming processes, analysis
and defects. Welding, brazing and soldering, process and defects. Machining processes and analysis, machine tools
and cutting tool geometry. Polymer processing, metrology and instrumentation. Limits, fits and tolerances. Related
laboratory experiments.

2. Scope and Objective of the C ourse:

An in-depth comprehension of various manufacturing processes is mandatory for a mechanical or manufacturing
engineer, as physical component or product is obtained through proper transformations according to design
requirement. Therefore, an attempt has been made to nurture the fresh talents for converting them into an efficient
manufacturing engineer by studying various manufacturing processes in details. This course is designed to enrich
theoretical, analytical as well as practical knowledge about conventional manufacturing processes such as casting,
forming, welding and machining used in product fabrication and development. In addition to it, this course also
aims to introduce polymer processing and powder metallurgy techniques along with brief introduction of
metrology.
