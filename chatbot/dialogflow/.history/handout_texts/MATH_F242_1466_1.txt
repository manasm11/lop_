SECOND SEMESTER 2019-20
COURSE HANDOUT
Date: 16.01.2021

In addition to the part I (General Handout for all courses appended to the Timetable) this portion gives further specific
details regarding the course.

Course No : MATH F242
Course Title : OPERATIONS RESEARCH
Instructor-in-C harge : CHANDRA SHEKHAR

1. Course Description:
This course begins with applications overview of Operations Research and introduces dynamic programming and
network models. After a review of probability distributions, inventory models and queuing systems will be covered.
Decision- making under certainty, risk, and uncertainty, along with an introduction to game theory, will be dealt.
Finally, simulation techniques, introduction for estimating solutions to problems that are not amenable to conventional
solution techniques, will be made. Students will also be taught the basic concepts of system reliability.

2. Scope and Objective of the C ourse:
Course scope and objective are to cover some topics of operations research in which events occurred/happened at
random and involve the concepts of probability in their study. It gives the platform to the student to understand the
modeling of the real-life problem and to computed expected performance measures.
