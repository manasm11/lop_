2. Scope and Objective of the Course: The course aims at covering topics in advanced areas of professional
interest and will be conducted on self-study and seminar basis. The course is specially designed to provide an
opportunity to the students for development of their academic skills and logical thinking through open ended
advanced study oriented activities. As a part of education, this course follows a method of learning and,
therefore, the student's actual day-to-day task involvement would constitute the central thread of the learning
process. The evaluation will recognize this aspect by demanding day-to-day productivity, punctuality and final
achievement of the student.

3. Operation of the course:

The plan of work for each student will be decided by the respective Instructors/supervisors. Each student
