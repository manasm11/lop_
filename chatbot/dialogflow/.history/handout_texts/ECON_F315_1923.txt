1. Course Description: FIN F315 (ECON F315) - Financial Management - is a foundation course on Corporate
Finance. The course provides an in-depth coverage of array of decisions undertaken by the Financial Manager of

an organization for achieving the objectives of shareholder's wealth maximization principle.

In an increasingly competitive and globally integrated world, the roles and responsibilities of financial manager have
widened manifold in the past two decades. The fast-paced rise in a number of Indian companies in the new
millennium indicates the tremendous investments infused by profit-seeking investors amidst growth of the Indian
corporate sector. The wide-range of investment avenues available to investors explains the extent of innovations
happening in financial markets worldwide. This explosive growth is much attributable to the integration of world
markets, modern computational sophistication, and an ever-increasing role played by communications and
information technology. However, with uncontrolled growth comes the risk of an uncontrolled collapse and the

financial crisis of 2008 is a classic case of presence of fault lines in the financial markets.

To retain the confidence and faith of investors and forge robust and sustainable growth, the firms must impress
suppliers of capital (investors) with adequate rewards to compensate them for the risks they undertake. In this
pursuit of shareholder's wealth maximization, it is imperative that decisions taken by firms related to investment in
projects (capital budgeting), raising finances for undertaking investment decisions (financing) and rewarding
shareholders (dividend policy) deomonstrate management's competence and goodwill. However, this pursuit of
shareholder’s wealth maximization must ensure protecting the rights of stakeholders such as employees, suppliers,

customers and the environment etc.

The role of the financial manager - which is central to the decision-making concerning finances (money, capital,
investment etc.) — plays a critical role in ensuring seamless day-to-day operations, maintaining profitability and

sustaining reliable long-term performance along with its adherence to corporate social responsibility.

2. Scope and Objective of the C ourse: This course aims at introducing students to the fundamental Corporate
