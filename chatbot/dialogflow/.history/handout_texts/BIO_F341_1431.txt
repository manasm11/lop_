COURSE HANDOUT

 

 

Date: 18.01.2021

In addition to part I (General Handout for all courses appended to the Time table) this portion gives further
specific details regarding the course.

Course No : BIO F341

Course Title : Developmental Biology
Instructor-in-C harge : Meghana Tare
Instructor(s) : NA

Tutorial/Practical Instructors: Meghana Tare

1. Course Description:

Developmental Biology deals with the principles, processes and research involved in how a single-celled zygote is
transformed into an entire multi-cellular organism. Salient features in the development stages of model organisms (eg.
frog, chick, fruit fly, worm and mouse) would be taken up, to exemplify the general principles of development. The
course would provide to students a strong exposure to research advances and the interplay of various other areas like
molecular biology and genetics in developmental biology, via study of research/review articles from journals.

2. Scope and Objective of the C ourse:
Familiarize students with events occurring in the transformation of single cell into a multicellular three
dimensional organism.
