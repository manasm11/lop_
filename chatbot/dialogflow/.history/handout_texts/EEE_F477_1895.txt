COURSE HANDOUT

 

Date: 04.01.2020

In addition to part I (General Handout for all courses appended to the Time table) this portion gives further
specific details regarding the course.

Course No : EEE F477
Course Title : Modeling of Field-Effect Nano Devices
Instructor-in-C harge : Dr. Satyendra Kumar Mourya

1. Course Description: Physical principles and MOS transistor phenomena, developing models including
effective mobility, temperatures effects, and source/drain resistances. small-dimensional effects, impact
ionization, velocity saturation drain-induced barrier lowering (DIBL), ballistic operation, polysilicon
depletion, quantum effects, gate-tunneling currents, gate-induced drain leakage (GIDL) , fundamentals of lowpower (low-voltage) CMOS design issues; the threshold voltage shift (due to SCE) , increased leakage power,
sources of power , SOI MOS, (PDSOI, FDSOJ) , multigate (MG) MOSFET, electrostatic integrity and short
channel control, quantum mechanical origin, basics of BSIM CMG, compact models for multigate MOSFETs
, mobility in multiple gate devices, improvement of the mobility ,crystallographic orientations, strained Si
channels.

2. Scope and Objective of the C ourse:

This course is designed specifically for undergraduate students who have done an ‘Electronic Devices’ course earlier.
This course will enable them to pursue modelling techniques of MOS structures, beginning with MOSFETs. This will
be very helpful for those who would like to do further studies or want to work in the area of semiconductor devices and
VLSI. As added perks, practical research-oriented case studies shall be taken up with special emphasis on article writing
forjournals and conferences. This course is organized in five modules which covers various aspects of device modelling
of long channel and short channel MOSFETs and advanced field effect devices. First module includes basics of fieldeffect devices: physics and technology and is followed by the second module i.e. metal-insulator semiconductor
capacitor. The third module is about MOSFET models and short channel effects while the fourth module addresses SOI
and multigate devices. The fifth and final module consist of basic physics and applications of TFETs and memristors.
