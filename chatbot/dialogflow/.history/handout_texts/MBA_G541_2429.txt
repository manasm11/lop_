1. Course Description: Operations Strategy, Operations Performance, Capacity Strategy,
Purchasing and Supply Strategy, Process Technology Strategy, Improvement Strategy, Product
and Service Development and Organization, The Process of Operations Strategy-formulation,
and implementation, The Process of Operations Strategy- Monitoring and Control etc.

2. Scope and Objective of the Course: Operations strategy is the missing link between the
Operational strategy and the business strategy. It seeks to provide the concepts and suggests
approaches to develop competitive advantages for an organization on a long term basis on a
sustainable orientation. The subject has a direct and close connection with the strategy of
resource management. The evolution of the subject is of recent origin. It is of high significance
in the newly emerged business environment that is volatile, dynamic in changing customer
preferences with high emphasis on performance objectives as customization, delivery,
flexibility and variety, customer service, speed and more besides the classical performance
parameters of cost and quality. The course has been designed to enable the students to prepare,
comprehend and analyze operations strategy.

Some of the important decisions with which operations strategy is concerned are as follows:

¢ How should the organization satisfy the requirements of its customers?

¢ How should each function within the organization satisfy the requirements of its internal
customers?

¢ What intrinsic capabilities should the organization try and develop as the foundation for

its long-term success?

How specialized should the organization’s activities become?

Should the organization sacrifice some of its objectives in order to excel at others?

How big should the organization be?

Where should the organization locate its resources?

When should it expand or contract, and by how much?

What should it do itself and what should it contract out to other businesses?

How should it develop relationships with other organizations?

W hat type of technology should it invest in?

How should it organize the way it develops new products and services?

How should it bind together its resources into an organizational structure?

How should the organization’s resources and processes be improved and developed over

time?

¢ What guiding principles should shape the way any organization formulates its operations
strategy?

All these questions are not merely important —they are fundamental. No organization, whether
large or small, for-profit or not-for-profit, in the services or manufacturing sector and
international or local, can ignore such questions. Operations strategy is central, ubiquitous and
vital to any organization’s sustained success.
