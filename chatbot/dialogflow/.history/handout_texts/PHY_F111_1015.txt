In addition to part I (General Handout for all courses appended to the Time table) this portion gives further
specific details regarding the course.

Course No > PHY F111

Course Title : Mechanics, Oscillations and Waves
Instructor-in-Charge: Srijata Dey

Instructor(s): Rishikesh Vaidya, D. Bandyopadhyay, Kaushar Vaidya

V. Manjuladevi, Niladri Sarkar, Tapomoy G. Sarkar, Sandipan Dutta, Srijata Dey.

1. Course Description: The first half of the course deals with the applications of Newton’s laws to the
systems of particles and the study of linear and rotational motion using polar coordinates and physics of
non-inertial reference frames. The second half deals with oscillatory motion, coupled oscillations and
waves. There will be three lecture hours and one tutorial hour per week. Whereas the lectures would
mostly focus on concepts and illustrative examples tutorial hour will be used to discuss representative
problems from the chapters. Tutorial will follow the lectures as closely as possible.

2. Scope and Objective of the Course: Mechanics, Oscillations and Waves is a foundation course in Physics
that is mandatory for all the first degree students.
