In addition to part I (General Handout for all courses appended to the Time table) this portion gives further
specific details regarding the course.

Course No : CS F111

Course Title : Computer Programming

Instructor-in-C harge : Dr. Sundaresan Raman

Instructor(s) :Dr. Sundaresan Raman (sundaresan.raman@ pilani.bits-pilani.ac.in)

Tutorial/Practical Instructors: Dr. Sundaresan Raman (sundaresan.raman@ pilani.bits-pilani.ac.in)

1. Course Description: The primary goals of the course are to introduce:

e Basic representation of data and how to process data using the representation inside a
computer.

e Techniques for specifying data, operations on data, and problem solving using C
programming language.

e Systematic techniques and approaches for constructing programs.

2. Scope and Objective of the Course: The course covers the following topics: Basic Model of a
Computer; Problem Solving — Basic Computing Steps and Flow. Programming Constructs
— Expressions, Statements, Conditionals, Iterators/Loops, Functions/Procedures; Data
Types — Primitive Types, Tuples, Lists/Arrays, Pointers and Dynamically Allocated Data.
Input output and Files.

Students can write
simple C programs,
compile and execute
them in a Unix
environment

Students can evaluate
arithmetic expressions
and specify the exact
internal data
representation.
Given an iterative or
conditional, students
would be able to use
the loop constructs / ifelse construct
appropriately.
Given a complex
problem statement,
students will be able to
logically break down
into simpler modules
involving pointers and
arrays, and write a
modular program using

and Initiative

In-class quizzes will be held regularly throughout the semester. Giving these and showing active

participation during the classes (say, by asking questions and responding to the instructor, interacting

across the teams during team based activity) would count toward the Class Participation and Initiative.

7. Chamber C onsultation Hour:

To be announced in the lecture sessions.

To contact the practical class instructors for consultation, you may send them an email.

8. Notices: All announcements will be done through online platforms such as Nalanda. More
details shall be shared in the lecture sessions.

9, Make-up Policy:Make-ups are generally considered only for medical emergencies leading
to hospitalization (or a personal emergency of similar nature). The decision by the
Instructor-in-Charge regarding granting make-ups shall be final.

10. Note:

Award of grades would be guided in general by the histogram of marks. If a student does
not give sufficient opportunity for being assessed, either by missing a component entirely or
by not applying oneself to the task seriously, he/she may be awarded ‘NC’ report.
