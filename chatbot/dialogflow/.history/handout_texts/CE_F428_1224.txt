SECOND SEMESTER 2018-2019
C ourse Handout Part-II
Date: 16-01-2021

In addition to part -I (General Handout for all courses appended to the time table) this portion gives further specific details

regarding the course.
Course No. : CE F428
Course Title : Earthquake Resistant Design and C onstruction

Instructor-in-charge :GMUTHUKUMAR (M - 10!" HOUR; T, TH — 38” HOUR)

1 Course Description: This course covers the fundamentals of dynamics of structures and design aspects of structures
Subjected to earthquake. Since the code provisions have been revised in the last few years, stronger emphasis will be
given to understand the basic premise on which codes were built. Emphasis will also be given on the best construction

practices.

2 (a): Scope of the C ourse:
The scope of the course is to know the various aspects in the analysis, design and construction to achieve safe and

economical earthquake resistant Reinforced Concrete structures. This course includes, introduction to structural
dynamics with strong emphasis on design aspects. The concepts of the earthquake resistant design will be discussed in
detail along with the design examples of different structures (framed structures, shear wall-frame, water tank, Chimney

etc).

2(b): Objectives of the course:
> To understand the basic concepts of earthquake engineering in general and structural dynamics in particular

[Module - I]
> To study important methods to solve the equation of dynamic equilibrium [Module - IT]

Vv

To study response analysis methods using mode superposition and response spectrum [ Module-IIT]

Vv

To understand various codal provisions for safe and effective design of RC structures for seismic loading
[Module-IV |

To understand the various design steps for columns, beams, beam-column joint [Module-V |

To understand intricacies and guidelines for overhead tanks, chimneys and shear walls [Module VI]

To discuss the various structural configurations and its merits & demerits [Module VII]

To highlight the drawbacks of non-engineered construction [Module VIII]

To highlight the good detailing practices in RCC structures [Module IX |

To summarize the building failures and design errors [Module X ]
