SECOND SEMESTER 2020-21
COURSE HANDOUT
Date: 18/01/2021

In addition to part I (General Handout for the course append to the time table) this portion gives further
specific details regarding course.

Course No. : PHY F241
Course Title : Electromagnetic Theory II
Instructor in charge : Madhukar Mishra

1. Course Description : The course constitutes the second half of a comprehensive course on electromagnetic theory. It
covers the following main topics - Review of Maxwell’s equations, Conservation Theorems of Electrodynamic systems,
Electromagnetic radiation, Relativistic formulation of electrodynamics, Radiation damping

2. Scope and objective : The course will take as staring point Maxwell’s equations, which form the core of
electrodynamics, and go through certain implications of these equations, namely, conservation theorems for an
electromagnetic system, electromagnetic radiation. It will also include the relativistic formulation and corrections of
classical electrodynamics.
