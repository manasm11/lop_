* Case studies, interpretation of data and then analysis, will form a part of all evaluation
components. Assignments(s) may include seminar presentation and
Assignment(s)/Quizzes may be practical / theory oriented, for which a proper documentation
and submission of records and reports in a standard format should be submitted as per

 

viva.

deadline(s) that would be announced.

It may also include a viva and or seminar
presentation(s).

Assignment(s) may be filed work / practical / theory oriented, for which one copy of type-written
report in a_ standard format should be submitted as per deadline(s) that would be announced,
therein. It may also include a viva and or a seminar presentation. However all assignments/reports
would be completed by last week of Nov., 2020 (date will be intimated). It is necessary that all
students stick to time schedule and DO NOT postpone submission of assignments/reports. This will

prevent extra load during last two weeks of class work. No make-up will be given for time defined
assignments, field studies.

Quiz(zes) may/will be conducted as a part of evaluation component, at random, during contact
hours including lecture, tutorial hours, with/without prior intimation and sometimes outside class
contact hours, and hence it is expected that the students come prepared to every class on topics
covered in earlier contact hours. Students are also requested to refresh their knowledge in basic
subjects, as relevant. No make-ups will be possible for the same.

S It is strongly advised that all students prepare their own class notes and relevant information from
text, reference material, which would only be allowed for consultation during open book/notes

*Slides used during class hours provide key information for which additional supportive information is
expected to be collected from sources aforementioned. These slides will not be shared SEPARATELY
and hence students are requested/advised to make their own notes during class hour. Recent
developments in the area/topic will be discussed in class based on their significance to healthcare
delivery and hence some information on therapeutic benefits and toxicity effects, besides others,
may differ from the information in text, reference material and hence students are expected to take
note of such key discussions during contact hours. Such discussions held in class will be considered
as primary source of information in assessments. Also note that all classes will be held (online/in
person) as announced by AUGRD/AUGSD, from time to time and students are requested to note the
same.

* Attendance is equally important which may be directly / indirectly related to grading.

* All evaluation components are equally important, irrespective of weightage. Hence, students failing to
attend or absenting themselves in one or many of the evaluation components or classes, may become
ineligible for obtaining a valid grade at the end of the semester. Therefore, students are strongly advised
to keep away from absenting themselves from all aforementioned contact sessions. Clearing the course
would require adequate performance in written quizzes**, tests**, examinations**, assignments,
separately (i.e. procuring low marks in written evaluation components, would not suffice, to clear the
course).

e Forall evaluation components, information given in class lectures, tutorials, text books
and reference books, in the same order will be considered, as correct. All evaluation
components are equally important, irrespective of weightage. Hence, students failing to
attend or absenting themselves in one or many of the evaluation components may
become ineligible for obtaining a valid grade, at the end of the semester. Attendance is
equally important and may be taken into consideration, during grading.

 

Any other adaptive changes in the handout, will be announced in class, if any.

6. Reading Assignments :

Students are advised to read, collect additional information on the above mentioned topics as per given
schedule. In addition, awareness w.r.t. latest developments in the area would be an added advantage.

* As this is an elective course, more stress will be laid upon latest information available from different
primary and secondary sources such as latest edition of books, journals, articles published and research
findings, reported in standard literature, independent studies, newsletters, etc. The chapters mentioned in
the text-books would give basic information related to topics whereas the class room information would

give latest developments and their applications in the field. Hence, only reference to text / reference material
would not suffice and students are advised to take a note of the same.
