SECOND SEMESTER 2020-21
COURSE HANDOUT
Date: 16.01.2021

In addition to part I (General Handout for all courses appended to the Time table) this portion gives further
specific details regarding the course.

Course No : EEE F346
Course Title : Data Communications and Networks
Instructor-in-C harge : HARSHAVARDHAN S

Instructor(s) :

Tutorial/Practical Instructors:

1. Course Description: Communication Concepts; Data and Voice Communications; Hardware Systems and
Configurations; Network Topologies and Design Aspects; Protocols; Networking Local Area Networks;
Network Security and Management; Emerging Trends in Communications.

2. Scope and Objective of the Course: A communication network is one of the fastest growing areas today.
The course introduces the concepts and mechanisms underlying the modern telecommunication systems and
networks. The course is designed in such a way that the course is accessible to students without any special
technical background in this area. The OSI model is used as a framework to introduce different protocols
and standards. The course will prepare the student for advanced courses in the areas: telecommunication
switching systems, computer networks, and internetworking etc.
