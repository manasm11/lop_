Students are strongly advised to prepare their own notes based on class lectures and relevant information from
textbook and reference material, as only these notes would only be allowed for consultation during assessments of
open book evaluation components. Photocopies of any material, written or printed will not be permitted. Stapled
sheets, loose sheets of information written or printed will not be allowed.

* Slides used during class hours provide key information for which additional supportive information is expected
to be collected from sources aforementioned. Recent developments in the area/topic will be discussed in class
based on their significance to healthcare delivery and hence some information on therapeutic benefits and toxicity
effects, besides others, may differ from the information in text, reference material and hence students are expected
to take note of such key discussions during contact hours. Such discussions held in class will be considered as
primary source of information in assessments.

Quiz(zes) may/will be conducted as a part of evaluation component, at random, during contact hours including
lecture, tutorial hours, as convenient, with/without prior intimation and sometimes outside class contact hours and
hence it is expected that the students come prepared to every class on topics covered in earlier contact hours.
Regular classes will be held in designated tutorial hour to maintain continuity.

 

7. Chamber Consultation Hour: To be announced in the class.

8. Notices: Pharmacy Notice Board.

9. Make-up Policy: Make-ups are not given as a routine. It is solely dependent on the “genuineness” of the
circumstances under which a student fails to appear in a scheduled evaluation component. Prior permission should be
sought from the instructor-in-charge in advance.

10. Note (if any): Grading Procedure: As specified in Handout — Part I, appended to the timetable, the

instructor in-charge reserves the right to award a NC report in case the student does not make himself/ herself
available for any of the evaluation component mentioned above. Also it is not imperative on part of the
instructor in-charge to award all the grades. Borderline cases during grading will be judged on the basis of
regularity to classes and consistency or progress in the performance in evaluation components. The maximum
pull-up to be exercised by the instructor in-charge will be announced in the class and shall be based on the
subjective judgment of the evaluator.

All evaluation components are equally important, irrespective of weightage. Hence, students failing to attend
scheduled classes, or absenting themselves in one or many of the evaluation components, may become
ineligible for obtaining a valid grade at the end of the semester. Attendance in lectures are all equally
important as they are all integral components of learning, irrespective of weightage and may be taken into
consideration, during grading.

Hence, students are strongly advised to keep away from absenting themselves from all aforementioned
contact sessions. Clearing the course would require adequate performance (i.e. procuring low marks
in evaluation components, aforementioned would not suffice, to clear the course).
