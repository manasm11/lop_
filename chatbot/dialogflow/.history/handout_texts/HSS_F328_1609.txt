1. Course Description: This course is floated to provide a brief understanding about the practical ramification (or
better subfield) of human resource management and deals with the significant issues related to developing human
resources with special reference to its tripartite foundations of human betterment, organizational enhancement and
societal development. The course will help clarify the subtle difference between HR Management & HR Development.
This will also enable the learners to know more about how training programs are planned, conceived, constructed and
delivered to the potential stakeholders. HRD essentially focuses on this core idea as to how the capabilities and
credentials (and ultimately productivity) of the employees can be enhanced.

2. Scope and Objective of the C ourse: To develop a conceptual framework for understanding human behavior in
organizations and develop human capital (manpower) in various sectors and spheres of the world of work. The course
would be very beneficial for students trying to understand the management functions of one very significant department
of any organization.
