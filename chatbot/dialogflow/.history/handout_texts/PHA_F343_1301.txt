Students are strongly advised to prepare their own class notes using relevant information from lectures,
text, reference books, and research/review articles given above. These notes are to be prepared/written in
separate, dedicated notebook for this course and notebooks containing notes from other courses will not
be allowed during closed book exam/quizzes. These handwritten notes and prescribed text would only be
allowed for consultation during exams and should only be used for answering the open book components.
Photocopies of any material (including research/review articles), written or printed will not be permitted.
Stapled sheets, loose sheets of information written or printed, photocopies of slides used for discussion in
class will not be allowed.

Slides, web-resources, educational/informative videos, multimedia resources and/or software/databases
displayed during lectures provide key information for which additional supportive information is expected
to be collected from these and aforementioned sources. The slides and selected material/information may
(or may not) be shared and hence students are requested/advised to make their own notes during lecture

I eee
hour. Recent developments in the area/topic will be discussed in class based on their significance to
pharma sciences or regulations, and may differ from the information in text, reference material and hence
students are expected to take note of such key discussions during lectures. Such discussions held in class
will be considered as primary source of information in the assessments.

Quiz(zes) may/will be conducted as a part of evaluation component, at random, during contact hours
including lectures, tutorial hours, as convenient, with/without prior intimation and hence it is expected that
the students come prepared to every class on topics covered in earlier lectures. Students are also requested
to refresh their knowledge in basic organic reactions, chemical and biochemical concepts, and in topics
and concepts covered in the prerequisite courses.

Mid-Sem. Grading would be done once at least 30-40 % evaluation components are completed.

For all evaluation components, information given during online lectures, aforementioned text books and
reference books in the same order, will be considered as correct. Students are advised to follow the text,
reference material as given in hand-out. All evaluation components are equally important, irrespective of
weightage. Hence, students failing to attend scheduled online classes/lab sessions, or absenting themselves
in one or many of the evaluation components, may become ineligible for obtaining a valid grade at the end
of the semester. Attendance in online lectures, timely submission of assignments, and quizzes are all
equally important as they are all integral components of learning, irrespective of weightage and will be
taken into consideration, during grading.

Hence, students are strongly advised to keep away from absenting themselves from all aforementioned
contact sessions. Clearing the course would require adequate performance in written quizzes, tests,
assignments, and examinations, separately (i.e. earning low marks in evaluation components,
aforementioned, would not suffice, to clear the course).

Any other adaptive changes in the handout, will be announced in class, if any.

Reading Assignments: Students are advised to read, collect additional information on the above mentioned
topics as per given schedule.

. Mid-semester evaluation: Will be announced after mid test

. Attendance: Regularity in attendance will be one of the criteria in deciding the borderline cases at the

time of final grading.

Make-up:

Generally make-up will be considered only for regular students (~90% attendance) under very rare
circumstances based on the genuineness of the case assessed on a case-to-case basis. No makeup will be
granted for assignments, quizzes and all would be considered for evaluation.

Online/Chamber consultation hours:

Students are advised to attend the majority of the classes (>95 %), read study material, given literature,
textbooks and reference books on all topics within a week of the topic being covered in the lectures. They
are also encouraged to ask clarification on major queries on the subject matter within the lecture hours and
minor (non-urgent) queries can be reserved for consultation hours. The consultation hour has been set for

every Wednesday 4-5 pm and may be adjusted based on alterations in the time table and availability of the
