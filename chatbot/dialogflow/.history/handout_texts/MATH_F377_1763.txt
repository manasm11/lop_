academic skills and logical thinking through open-ended lab oriented design activities. As a part of
education, this project course follows a method of learning and therefore, the student's actual dayto-day task involvement would constitute the central thread of the learning process. The evaluation
will recognize this aspect by demanding day-to-day productivity and punctuality of the student.

9. Grading Procedure:

In addition to what is mentioned in Part I of the handout, the grading will be done mainly on the
basis of the progress made towards attainment of the project objectives and will recognize that each
Instructor has given specific task situation in which the student participates in a cognitive manner.
Thus each Instructor will recommend a grade for his student for the consideration of the
Instructor-in-charge. In a specialized course of this nature, the respective Instructor's assessment of the
student vis-a-vis the objective of the project would be the central criteria for arriving at final grade.

6. General:
