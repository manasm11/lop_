COURSE HANDOUT
Date: 12-01-2021

In addition to part I (General Handout for all courses appended to the Time table) this portion gives further
specific details regarding the course.

Course No : ME/MF F221

Course Title : Mechanisms and Machines

Instructor-in-C harge : J S Rathore

Tutorial Instructors Amol Marathe, Amit R Singh, J S Rathore, Venkatesh KP Rao

1. Course Description:

Kinematics analysis of planar mechanism: Introduction to mechanisms, displacement, velocity,
acceleration analysis, synthesis of planar mechanism, cam design, kinematics of gears, gear trains,
Dynamics of machines: static force analysis, dynamic force analysis (planar), dynamics of reciprocating
engines, balancing, flywheels, gyroscopes. Introduction to spatial and compliant mechanism.

2. Scope and Objective of the C ourse:
The first part deals with kinematics of simple mechanisms and motion generation, which lays foundation
for further study in Dynamics and Vibration. The second part introduces some of basic concepts in the
analysis of dynamic systems, kinetics of machine parts.
