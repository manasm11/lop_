SECOND SEMESTER 2020-21
C ourse Handout (Part II)
Date: 14.01.2021

In addition to part I (General Handout for all courses appended to the Time table) this portion gives
further specific details regarding the course.

Course No : PHA F414
Course Title : BIOPHARMACEUTICS
Instructor-in-C harge : Dr. Gautam Singhvi

1. Course Description:

Biopharmaceutics and Biopoharmaceutical aspects of drug delivery covering absorptions,
distribution, metabolism and elimination (ADME) characters of drugs. Compartment model,
pharmacokinetics of drugs and their applications, bioavailability, bioequivalence and their studies,
drug-drug interactions and other related matters.

2. Scope and Objective of the C ourse:

The prime objective of this course is to impart knowledge of biopharmaceutical process based on
fundamental concepts. The primary focus will be on mechanisms of and factors influencing drug
absorption as well as bioavailability. This course also deals with distribution, biotransformation and
excretion of drugs. In order to develop a background knowledge in the up-coming field like
pharmacokinetics, a brief discussion about basic considerations in pharmacokinetics such as rates
and orders of reactions, compartment modeling, bioequivalance and design of dosage regimen is
also included. The knowledge of this branch of pharmacy is very essential for a professional
pharmaceutical scientist, as concepts regarding plasma drug concentration profile, Bioavailability
and Bioequivalance as well as Dosage Regimen is resourceful working tool in every branch of
pharmacy, be it pharmaceutics, pharmacology or medicinal chemistry. Therefore, it is essential for
every graduate student in pharmacy to be familiar with the outlines of these concepts and that is
what this course aims to achieve.
