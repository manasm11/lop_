Evaluation Weightage :
30% (30) | Closed Book
30% (60) | Closed Book

 

Continuous

assessment* 0

(Assignment(s), 40% (40) Open book
Presentation, Reports)

* Assignment(s) may be practical / theory oriented, for which a proper report in a standard format
should be submitted as per deadline(s) that would be announced. Presentation will be based research
articles. All evaluation components are equally important irrespective of weightage. Hence,
students failing to attend or absenting themselves in one or many of the evaluation components
may become ineligible for obtaining a valid grade at the end of the semester. It shall be the
responsibility of the individual student to be regular in maintaining the self study schedule as given
in the course handout, attend lectures as per the schedule announced

Chamber consultation hour: To be announced in class.
