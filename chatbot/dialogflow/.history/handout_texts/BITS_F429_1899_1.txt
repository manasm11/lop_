SECOND SEMESTER 2020-21
COURSE HANDOUT
Date: 14.01.2021

In addition to part I (General Handout for all courses appended to the Time table) this portion gives further
specific details regarding the course.

Course No : BITS F 429

Course Title : Nanotechnology for Renewable Energy and Environment
Instructor-in-C harge : Krishna Etika

Instructor(s) : Banasri Roy

1. Course Description:

The course introduces the fundamentals of nanoscience and technology and its applications in the areas of
renewable energy and environment. It includes concepts such as macro vs. nano, physics at the nanoscale
and unique properties of nanomaterials that make them a viable alternative to conventional materials. This
course also includes basic fabrication, characterization and working mechanisms of solar cells (i.e., organic,
quantum dot and dye sensitized solar cells), Fuel cells, batteries and carbon nanotube based energy storage
devices. Furthermore, aspects of nanotechnology applications in solar cells, nanoelectrodes, catalysts
systems for fuel cells and batteries are also included. This course further introduces the environmental
applications of nanotechnology in sustainability, ground water remediation, adsorbents, ecotoxicological and
toxicity of nanomaterials, transport and fate of nanomaterials and societal implications of nanotechnology.

2. Scope and Objective of the C ourse:
Nanotechnology promises to be the technology of the future benefitting the humanity in a number of ways.
This course is aimed at preparing students for further industrial or academic work in the field of nano
technology with focus on renewable energy and environment sector. The course is divided into 3 modules as
decribed below.

o Module 1: General introduction to principles of nanoscience and technology

o Module 2: Nanotechnology applications in renewable energy sector

o Module 3: Nanotechnology applications in environmental sector.
The specific topics covered under each module are listed in the course plan (refer section 5 of this handout).

By the end of this course, the student will be able to:
o Describe the importance of nanomaterials and the origin of their unique properties.
o Summarize the fabrication characterization and working of solar cells, fuel cells, batteries, and CNT
based energy storage devices.
o List the merits and motivations for using nanomaterials in renewable energy and environment sector.
o Gauge the applicability of alternate nanomaterials for use in energy and environment sector.
o Define toxic effect of nanotechnology on environment, relative remediation and precautions.
