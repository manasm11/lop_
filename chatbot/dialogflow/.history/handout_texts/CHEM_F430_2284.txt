ugdSECOND SEMESTER 2020-21
COURSE HANDOUT
Date: 15.01.2021

In addition to part I (General Handout for all courses appended to the Time table) this portion gives further
specific details regarding the course.

Course No : CHEM F430
Course Title : Atmospheric C hemistry
Instructor-in-C harge : Shamik Chakraborty

1. Course Description: Measures of atmospheric compositions, Atmospheric pressure, Models to explain
variation in concentration of chemical species in atmosphere, Atmospheric transport, Continuity equation to
provide quantitative measures about the variation of concentration of various chemical species in atmosphere,
Geochemical cycles, Photochemistry, the Green House Effect, Aerosols, Chemical Kinetics, Stratospheric
ozone, Oxidation in troposphere, Ozone air pollution, Acid rain.

2. Scope and Objective of the Course: The fundamental concepts of Atmospheric Chemistry would be
provided in this course in a systematic and organized manner. Simple principles of mathematics, physics, and
chemistry would be employed to describe a complex system, such as, atmosphere. The complexity of the
system would be reduced logically to develop various models. The fundamental knowledge of atmospheric
chemistry, along with the description of experiments that lead to the current status would be discussed in this
course. Atmospheric chemistry is mostly an observational science. Some of those concepts would also be
introduced in this course.

3. Text Books: "Introduction to Atmospheric Chemistry", Daniel J Jacob, Princeton University Press, Princeton,
New Jersey, 1999.

4, Reference Books: RB-1: “Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics: From Air Pollution to Climate Change”
John H. Seinfeld and Spyros N. Pandis, John Wiley & Sons, Inc., Hoboken, New Jersey, 2016.

RB-2: “Atmospheric Thermodynamics”, Gerald R. North and Tatiana L. Erukhimova, Cambridge University
Press, New Y ork, 2009.

9. Learning Outcome of the Course: After completion of the course students are expected to:

e Predict the fate of molecules and radicals in atmosphere.

e Qualitatively explain and quantitatively calculate photolysis rate constant.
e Explain basic principles of greenhouse effect.

e Qualitatively explain production and destruction of ozone.

e Predict degradation pathways of natural and anthropogenic trace gases.
