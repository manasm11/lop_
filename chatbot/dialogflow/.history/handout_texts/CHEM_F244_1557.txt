SECOND SEMESTER 2020-2021
Course Handout (Part IJ)

Date: 18.01.2021

In addition to Part I (General Handout for all courses appended to the time table) this portion gives further specific details regarding this course.

Course No. : CHEM F244
Course Title : Physical Chemistry III
Instructor-in-charge : RAM KINKAR ROY

Scope and objective of the course: This course is designed in continuation to the Physical chemistry courses I and II, already offered to the
students. Physical Chemistry III course is composed of two parts. In the first portion, students would be exposed to the molecular symmetry,
principles of group theory, and its application in molecular spectroscopy. The second portion provides a comprehensive survey of various
approximation methods in quantum chemistry.

Course Description: Symmetry - symmetry operations, point groups, reducible and irreducible representations, character tables, SALC,
degeneracy, vibrational modes IR-Raman activity identification; stationary state perturbation theory; virial and Hellmann-Feynmann theorems;
polyatomic molecules: SCF MO treatment, basis sets, population analysis, molecular electrostatic potentials, configuration interaction, Moller
Plesset perturbation theory; Density Functional Theory: Hohenberg-Kohn theorems, Kohn-Sham self consistent field approach, exchange
correlation functional; molecular mechanics.
