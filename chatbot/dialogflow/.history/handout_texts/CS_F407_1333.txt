Course Title : ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE
Instrutor-in-charge : NAVNEET GOYAL
Course Description

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a field of computer science that attempts to build technology to inculcate human
cognition in computer systems. A primary goal of AI is to build intelligent entities to mimic the attributes of
human intelligence such as problem solving, reasoning, planning, uncertainty handling, learning etc. The course
introduces students to a large collection of algorithms and techniques for building these intelligent entities. By the
end of the course, the students should have a general knowledge of the field of AI. They should be able to
recognize when and how to use AI techniques to solve problems. The students should also be able to evaluate new
techniques they encounter.

This course covers the issues and techniques involved in the creation of computer systems that display intelligent
behavior. The following are among the topics that we will cover: AI search techniques, Game Playing, Planning,
Knowledge Representation, Reasoning under Uncertainty and Reinforcement Learning.
