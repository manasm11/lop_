1. Scope and Objective of the course

The scope of the course is the basic concepts and implementation issues of a Database System. This course is
intended to give students a solid background in databases, with a focus on relational database management
systems. Topics include data modeling, database design theory, data definition and manipulation languages,
storage and indexing techniques, query processing and optimization, concurrency control and crash recovery.The
emphasis is on learning the concepts through rigorous mathematical foundations and implementation details. The
course also introduces the challenges posed by Big Data on database technology and the recent emergence of
Non-relational databases.
