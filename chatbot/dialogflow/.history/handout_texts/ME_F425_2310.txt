SECOND SEMESTER 2020-2021
Course Handout (Part IT)

In addition to the part I (General Handout for all courses appended to the time table) this portion gives further
specific details regarding the course.

Course No.: ME F425
Course Title: Additive Manufacturing
Instructor-in-C harge: Radha Raman Mishra

1. Course Description

Additive manufacturing is an emerging manufacturing technology that can create a paradigm shift in complex
parts production. In this course, the basic principles of Additive Manufacturing (AM), generalized AM
process and process chain, modelling of AM processes, transport phenomena models, molten pool formation,
and use of different materials in AM will be discussed. Various AM processes such as vat polymerization
processes, powder-based AM processes, extrusion-based AM processes, sheet lamination processes and
micro- and nano-additive manufacturing processes will be covered with their mechanics of operation.
Moreover, selected case studies for modelling of AM processes will be analysed, and applications of AM in
industries such as Aerospace, Automotive, Electronics and Biomedical applications will be discussed.

2. Scope and Objective of the C ourse

The present course introduces theoretical and analytical knowledge about common additive manufacturing
processes. Moreover, it enables learners to understand the process and material selection, design of AM
processes and industrial applications of AM technologies.
