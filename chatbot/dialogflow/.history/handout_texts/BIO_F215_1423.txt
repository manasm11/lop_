In addition to part-I (General Handout for all courses appended to the timetable) this portion gives further specific

details regarding the course.

Course No. : BIO F215

Course Title : BIOPHYSICS
Instructor-In-Charge : SHIBASISH CHOWDHURY

:Navin Singh

1. SCOPES AND OBJECTIVE:

The objective of the course is to introduce the students to the concepts of physical principles in the biological
and biomimetic molecular systems. Properties and conformations of biomolecules like amino acids, proteins,
nucleotides, nucleic acids as well as biomimetic systems like monolayers and bilayers are to be discussed.
Related physical phenomena in these systems like structural transitions, protein folding, membrane equilibria
are to be discussed. Emphasis will also be given to understand the principles of major experimental techniques
applied to understand these physical problems.
