C ourse Handout Part II
Date: 20/01/2021

In addition to Part-I (General Handout for all courses appended to the timetable) this portion gives further specific
details regarding the course.

Course No. : ECON F354 / FIN F311
Course Title : Derivatives & Risk Management
Instructor-in-charge : ARUN KUMAR VAISH

1. Scope & Objective:

The objective of this course is to provide students an introductory level familiarity with a particular
type of financial instruments known as DERIVATIVES. To achieve the stated objectives the course
provides a detailed description on the structure (read, design) and utility (read, relevance) of the
most common and popular financial derivatives namely, Options, Futures, and Swaps. The scope of
the course entails acquainting students with the mechanics of trading and settlement of derivative
instruments in the financial markets and their function as insurance products for hedging financial
risk.

No understanding about financial instruments or their derivatives is complete without a thorough
grasp over interest rate concepts and hence the course also includes discussion on topics such as
time value of money, term structure of interest rates and their role in valuation of bonds,
computation of yield and forward interest rates, estimating bond-price volatility, and the role of
bond duration and convexity in mitigating interest rate risks.

The topics covered in the course will, at an introductory level, enable participants to learn about
common risks prevalent in the financial markets and how to manage its impact on investment
exposure by using derivatives. Discussion on valuation of financial derivatives and a brief
introduction to creating synthetic investment positions by combining derivatives prepares students
for advanced level courses such as Financial Engineering and Financial Risk Analytics and
Management. The course concludes with a survey of selective topics of contemporary interest to risk
management industry such as forecasting volatility, estimating value-at-risk, etc. The topics covered
in the course will also assist students in preparing for competitive professional international
certifications such as Financial Risk Manager (FRM) and Chartered Financial Analyst (CFA).

2. Prerequisites: This is an elementary course on Derivatives and Risk Management and does not
assume any prior knowledge of Financial Markets, Instruments and Derivatives. However,
familiarity of basic economic theory such as law of supply and demand, utility maximization
principle, compounding and discounting of cash flows, etc. are desirable. The course is not
mathematically rigorous and a first-year course on elementary linear algebra, calculus, probability,
and differential equations will be sufficient to grasp the contents of the course. It is expected that
students have technical know-how of MS excel as it will be used to demonstrate required
computations, wherever required, and for carrying out take-home assignments.
