1. Course Description:

Casting; metal forming; Joining Processes; metal cutting machines e.g., Sand casting, rolling,
extrusion, forging, arc welding, gas welding, lathe, shaper, drilling, milling and grinding;
Engineering metrology and equipment. Overview of Non-traditional manufacturing processes.
Laboratory exercise involving machining, joining and welding etc.

2. Course Objectives:

This course aims at imparting theoretical and practical aspects of the basic techniques and skills
used to manufacture metal and wooden products. This course provides an overview of the basic
manufacturing processes and allied processes used to produce finished products from raw materials.
In addition to theory, demonstration of various basic manufacturing processes like sand casting,
machining, forming, sheet metal working and joining processes using common machine tools and
hand tools etc will be imparted.
