SECOND SEMESTER 2020-21
COURSE HANDOUT
Date: 17.01.2021
In addition to part I (General Handout for all courses appended to the Time table) this portion gives further
specific details regarding the course.

Course No. : BITS F441
Course title : ROBOTICS
Instructor-in-charge : B.K. ROUT

1. Scope and Objective of the course

Robotics is an interdisciplinary area ranging from mechanical & electrical component design to advanced
sensor technology, incorporating computer systems and Artificial Intelligence (AI). With advances in AItechniques & computational power in recent years, it has become one of the most interesting areas for
multidisciplinary research, with lots of commercial applications already in market.

The included subject matter, aims at developing thorough understanding of Robotics & its applications
in a unified and coherent manner; preparing students of engineering discipline for industries’ requirements
and applied research in the field. It will also make students capable of handling robot manipulator tasks in
real, as well as in simulation environment.
