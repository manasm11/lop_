SECOND SEMESTER 2018-19
COURSE HANDOUT
Date: 04.01.2020

In addition to part-| (General Handout for all courses) printed on page 1 of the Timetable book, this portion gives
further specific details regarding the course.

Course No : BIOG515

Course Title : Stem Cell and Regenerative Biology
Instructor -in-charge : Rajdeep Chowdhury

Instructors : None

1. Course Description: This course is intended to provide a comprehensive overview of current understanding of
stem cells, including their basic properties and interactions. The lectures will be organized into 3 sections. The first
section will give an overview of embryonic & adult stem cells and their basic characteristics. This area will discuss
general methods and unifying features and lay foundation for subsequent sections. The 2nd section will focus on
Stem Cells in Tissues and Organ Development. The final section will focus on iPSCs, stem cell isolation methods,
immunologic properties & potential therapeutic use of stem cells.

2. Scope and Objective of the Course:

The aim of this course is to provide an introduction to the subject of stem cells and approaches to regenerative
biology. Stem cells have generated considerable interest recently in the scientific, clinical, and public arenas. It is
essential that we gain a broader understanding of the factors that regulate the biology of stem cells: their ability for
self-renewal, differentiation and plasticity, as well as the differences between embryonic and adult stem cells, and
whether stem cells can be manipulated to replace cells in diseased tissues. Stem cells will also be discussed in the
context of cancer and the use of stem cells for cancer therapies.

8. Notices:

Announcements pertaining to the course will be made in the lecture/tutorial class. In some cases, printed notices
shall be displayed in the notice board of only the Department of Biological Sciences. Award of grades would be
guided by the histogram of marks. Decision for cases on borderline of two grades will be based on the student’s
promptness and participation in classroom activities as well as satisfactory attendance in lecture and tutorial classes.
If a student misses even a single component entirely or does not give sufficient opportunity for being assessed,
he/she may be awarded ‘NC’ report regardless of his/her final total score in the course (see Clause 4.19 of BITS
Academic Regulations).

9. Make-up Policy:

For a foreseen absence, make-up request should be made in person to the Instructor-in-Charge, well before the
scheduled evaluation component. Reasons for unanticipated absence that qualify a student to apply for make-up
include medical or similar personal emergencies only; in such an event, the student should contact the Instructor-inCharge as soon as practically possible. Make-ups for journal club presentations and quizzes/assignments are not
usually given. For regulations about the make-up flexibility, students are advised to refer to Clause 4.07 of B/TS
Academic Regulations
