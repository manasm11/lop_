In addition to part-I (General Handout for all courses appended to the time table) this
portion gives further specific details regarding the course.

Course No. : CE G618
Course Title : Design of Multi-storey Structures
Instructor-in- : ANSHUMAN

scope and Objective of the Course:

Paucity of land in urban areas has limited the horizontal extension of buildings
used for residential or commercial purposes. High-rise structures are advanced as a
solution to this problem. The present course intends to impart adequate knowledge
enabling the students to plan, analyse, design and construct high rise structures either in
steel, concrete or mix-type of applications. Initially, the various kinds of loads and
stresses to which the structure is subjected to, will be studied. Various important
components of tall structures like diaphragms, shear walls, tubular encasements will be
covered. Analysis and design against lateral loads (wind and earthquake) will also be
emphasized along with detailing of reinforcements in order to provide ductile and
efficient buildings.
