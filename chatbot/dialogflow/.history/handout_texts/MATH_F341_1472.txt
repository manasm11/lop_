Course Title : INTRODUCTION TO FUNCTIONAL ANALYSIS
Instructor-in-C harge : ASHISH TIWARI

Instructor(s)

Tutorial/Practical Instructors:

1. Course Description: Normed linear spaces, Banach Spaces; Continuous Linear transformations, open
mapping theorem, closed graph theorem, uniform boundedness principle, Hahn Banach theorem, Hilbert
space theory, dual space, direct sum and orthogonal compliment in Hilbert spaces, function spaces,
symmetric and self adjoint linear mapping in Hilbert spaces , finite rank and compact transformations,
spectral theory, differential equations and linear transformations

2. Scope and Objective of the Course: Functional analysis plays an important role in the applied sciences
as well as in mathematics itself. This course is intended to familiarize the student with the basic concepts,
principles and methods of functional analysis and its applications in a form suitable for engineers, scientists
and applied Mathematicians. Ideas are not always generated by logical process. An engineer may have a
feeling for a problem which may lead him in a method of solution but justifying part of that needs analysis.
Several concepts of functional analysis were invented as there was need from integral and differential
equations. Functional analysis is needed in numerical analysis and differential equations. Modern theory of
partial differential equations relies heavily on functional analysis. Theoretical study of numerical solution of
partial differential equations is also based on functional analysis.
