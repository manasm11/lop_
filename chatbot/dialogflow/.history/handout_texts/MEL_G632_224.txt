2. Scope and Objective of the C ourse:

This course aims at thorough understanding of the behavior of analog circuits and systems. The course focuses
on basic concepts in Analog IC design; different Design techniques for designing of analog and mixed-signal
VLSI circuits. Performance characterization is also envisaged using intuitive analysis and simulation
techniques. The simulation/ layout of linear integrated systems using EDA tools like Cadence, mentor graphics
is also included.

Objectives of the Course:

e Understand analog IC design issues, MOS device models, impact of scaling on performance, amplifier
characterization.

e Learn techniques to set DC bias, common mode feedback, replica bias, current/ voltage mirrors and
reference design, types of amplifiers and quiescent point location

e Understand small signal analysis and synthesis of different single/ multi stage amplifiers, OPAMP,
OTA and their design & characterization with and without feedback

e Current mode circuit design

e Noise/ distortion analysis in amplifiers, and low noise amplifier design

e Use of EDA tools in design/ characterization of amplifiers, analog layout techniques.
