Date: 10/02/2021

In addition to Part-I (General Handout for all courses appended to the Timetable) this portion gives
further specific details regarding the course.

Course No. : CS F222
Course Title : Discrete Structures for Computer Science
Instructor In Charge : Dr. Jagat Sesh Challa (jagatsesh@pilani.bits-pilani.ac.in)

2. SCOPE & OBJECTIVE:

To develop logical and mathematical concepts necessary to appreciate computational systems. And
study of concepts, techniques, and skills necessary to comprehend the structure of problems
encountered in design and analysis of algorithms. To provide mathematical foundations for courses in
computer science that rely upon the comprehension of formal abstract concepts. To study recursion
and to write recursive definitions for certain sequences and collections of objects. Graphs, directed
graphs, planar graphs & their relevance to circuit design & map colouring problems. Trees and their
applications. Basic algebraic structures and their applications.
