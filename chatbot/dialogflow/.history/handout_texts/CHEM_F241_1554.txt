1. Course Description:

Coordination Chemistry: Bonding - Valence Bond, Crystal Field, and Molecular Orbital theories;
Complexes - nomenclature, isomerism, coordination numbers, structure, electronic spectra, magnetic
properties, chelate effect; Reactions - nucleophilic substitution reactions, kinetics, mechanisms;
descriptive chemistry of Lanthanides and Actinides; Organometallic Chemistry: structure and reaction of
metal carbonyls, nitrosyls, dinitrogens, alkyls, carbenes, carbynes, carbides, alkenes, alkynes, and
metallocenes; catalysis by organometallic compounds; stereochemically non-rigid molecules.

2. Scope and Objective of the C ourse:

Throughout the semester representative topics from inorganic chemistry will be discussed to expose the
students to the theories of bonding, electronic spectra and magnetic properties of complexes, reactions of
metal complexes, detailed description of organometallic compounds and chemistry of lanthanides and
actinides. Various theories such as VBT, CFT followed by MOT will explain many topics encompassed
by electronic spectra, magnetic properties and finally in organometallic complexes in the field of
Inorganic Chemistry. However, we will strive in this course to address the most important theories and
applications of Inorganic Chemistry with the state of the art level which may motivate the students
towards research.

By the end of the semester, you will be able to

- Predict structure and geometry of inorganic complex

- Envisage spinel structure and chelate effect

- Learn the application of character table

- Investigate the origins of color and transitions in inorganic complexes

- Indentify the magnetic properties of inorganic compounds

- Be familiar with the organometallic reactions, mechanism, structure & bonding, catalytic properties

- Explore the chemistry of bridging ligands

- Be trained in f block elements from the periodic table
