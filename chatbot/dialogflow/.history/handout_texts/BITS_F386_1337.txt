SECOND SEMESTER 2019-2020
COURSE HANDOUT (PART II)
Date: 15.01.2021

In addition to Part I (General Handout for all courses appended to the Time Table), this portion gives
further specific details regarding the course.

Course Number: BITS F386
Course Title: Introduction to Quantum Information and Computation
Instructor-in-Charge: RR Mishra

Scope & Objectives: This is an introductory course on the rapidly developing interdisciplinary field of
Quantum Information and Computation. The course does not require a thorough knowledge of either
Computer Science or Quantum Physics. Relevant concepts of either subject will be developed during the
course of instruction.

Course Description: This course is divided into three main parts. (1) Foundation: Basic ideas and
interpretation of quantum mechanics relevant for understanding quantum information. (2) Quantum
Computation: Quantum circuit model, quantum gates, and quantum algorithms. (3) Quantum Information:
Quantum version of Shannon’s classical theory of information, quantum cryptography, error correction, etc.

Books:

Textbook : i) Quantum Computer Science, An introduction by N. David Mermin, Cambridge University Press
(2007)

ii) Quantum Information Theory, Second Edition by Mark M Wilde, Cambridge University Press, 2017
Reference books:
