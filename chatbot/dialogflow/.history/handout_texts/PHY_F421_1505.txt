SECOND SEMESTER 2020-21
COURSE HANDOUT

 

Date: 18.01.2021

In addition to part I (General Handout for all courses appended to the Time table) this portion gives further
specific details regarding the course.

Course No - PHY F421
Course Title : Advanced Quantum Mechanics
Instructor-in-C harge : Rakesh C houbisa

1. Course Description: This course will cover advanced topics of quantum mechanics. The course will start
with a quick recapitulation of the basics. Then it will discuss some topics which a Master student is expected
to know: such as symmetries, time-dependent perturbation, scattering, and indistinguishable particles. This
course will give a glimpse of an alternate formulation of quantum mechanics (path integral formulation) and
will also extend the study of quantum mechanics in the relativistic regime. This course will also time to time
highlight some applications of quantum mechanics.

2. Scope and Objectives of the C ourse:

e Quantum mechanics of time-dependent systems will be discussed

e The scattering of quantum particles will be discussed

e The role of symmetries in quantum mechanics will be emphasized (concept of group theory will be
introduced)

e Quantum mechanics of indistinguishable particles will be discussed (discussion on Bosons and
Fermions)

e The path integral formulation of quantum mechanics will be introduced

e Quantum mechanics in the relativistic regime will be discussed

8. Make-up Policy [Strict]: Strictly no make up for the tutorials. If the student is unable to appear for the
Regular Test/Examination due to genuine exigencies**, the student must refer to the procedure for applying
for Make-up Test/Examination. [**Sickness leading to hospitalization and out-of-station with prior
permission from/intimation to the IC]

9, Note (if any): It shall be the responsibility of the individual student to be regular in maintaining the self
study schedule as given in the course handout and attend lectures. Mid Semester Test and Comprehensive
Examination are according to the Evaluation Scheme given in the Course Handout.
