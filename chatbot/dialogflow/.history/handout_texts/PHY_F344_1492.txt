SECOND SEMESTER 2020-21
COURSE HANDOUT
Date: 15.01.2021

In addition to part I (General Handout for all courses appended to the Time table) this portion gives further
specific details regarding the course.

Course No : PHY F344
Course Title : Advanced Physics Laboratory
Instructor-in-charge : RAJ KUMAR GUPTA

Instructors: Anshuman Dalvi, Debashis Bandyopadhyay, Manjuladevi V., Raj Kumar Gupta, Subhashish
Gangopadhyay, Shivaraja S.J., Amrit Kumar, Shrishti Sharma, Sushil.

Ll. Course Description: This Course will cover some research level experimental skills as well as
knowledge about physical properties of different types of materials.

2. Scope and Objective of the course: The aim of the course is to provide the students with experimental
skills in performing measurements in different areas of Physics with a scope to get exposed to the
different specialized research fields in experimental physics (for example, condensed matter physics,
surface science, Liquid crystals, nanotechnology etc).

3. Text Books: No particular Text book

4. Reference Books: Experimental Manuals, literature and Lecture notes.

6. Learning outcome: The MSc Physics students will be given exposure to high end research level
experiments with five different themes in frontline areas. There are material aspects for understanding
their fundamental physical properties essential for device fabrication. The microwave lab enriches the
students with fundamental aspects of electromagnetic waves. The liquid crystal lab deals with
understanding physics involved in LCDs. The surface science lab teaches the essentials of thin film
based devices e.g sensor. The nanoscience lab deals with measurement and understanding of physical
properties at lower dimension.
