Scope and Objectives of the course:

When organizations face challenges such as an economy in recession, they depend on thoroughly
trained professionals who react quickly to the changes in the environment and create strategies for
success. Human Resource Management is responsible for carefully selecting and training people
with the necessary skills to pursue the strategy effectively. Some external factors can be predicted,
others such as the collapse of large banks and insurance companies, can seemingly come out of
nowhere. The challenges have been coming fast and furious as organizations struggle to adjust
strategy in the face of tumbling stock market, widespread layoffs and technology that has made
social networking a mainstream tool for business.

Human Resource Management course has been designed to educate students (future managers) as to
the functions of manager and the roles that manager must assume within organizations that led to
both individual and organizational success.

To achieve the objective stated above, classes will be structured primarily around lectures,
individual assessments, group activities and occasional videos.
