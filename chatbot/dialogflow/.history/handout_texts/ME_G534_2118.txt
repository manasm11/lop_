In addition to Part-I"(General Handout for all courses appended to the time table), this portion gives further
specific details regarding the course.

Course No. : ME G534

Course Title : CONVECTIVE HEAT AND MASS TRANSFER
Course Instructor : Chennu Ranganayakulu

Course Coordinator : Chennu Ranganayakulu

1. Scope and Objective of the C ourse:

This course has been designed to discuss various modes of convective heat transfers possible in real time
applications coupled with relevant theories. It covers possible combinations of laminar and turbulent flows,
internal and external flows, and natural and forced convection with mass transfer aspects. The course primarily
useful for persons who want to pursue research in Heat Transfer area and covers the following topics: Boundary
Layer Concepts; Laminar extemal flow, similarity solutions; Laminar duct flow, developing and fully
developed flow; Extemal natural convection, mixed convection; Natural convection in enclosures; Turbulent
boundary layer flow, Mixing-Length model, external flows; Turbulent duct flow, friction factor and pressure
drop, heat transfer coefficient; Convection during condensation and boiling; Mass transfer.
