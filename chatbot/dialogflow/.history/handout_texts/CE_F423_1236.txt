specific details regarding the course.

Course No : CE F423

Course Title : Green Buildings and Energy Conservation
Instructor-in-C harge : Rajiv Gupta

Instructor(s) :

Tutorial/Practical Instructors:

1. Course Description: Climate zones and sun path diagram, thermal comfort, heat flow through building
materials, energy efficient building design factors like site planning, plan form and orientation,
construction techniques, materials and finishes, natural day lighting and ventilation strategies, thermal
performance of building elements, simple techniques to recycle and reuse water, harvest rainwater,
green building rating system, case studies of traditional architecture and contemporary buildings,
building design using AUTOCAD

2. Scope and Objective of the Course: The course introduces green architecture and intends to equip
students with technical knowledge of energy-efficient green building. The course covers various
aspects of green architecture like climatology, passive solar architecture, water management. The
course will also guide students, through projects, to apply concepts and ideas for the design of a green
building.
