SECOND SEMESTER 2020-21
COURSE HANDOUT
Date: 18.1.2021

In addition to part I (General Handout for all courses appended to the Time table) this portion gives further
specific details regarding the course.

Course No : CE F429
Course Title : Design of Foundation System
Instructor-in-C harge : Ravi Kant Mittal

1. Course Description: Evaluation and interpretation of soil properties, dynamic properties of soil,
geophysical and seismic methods, Stress in soil mass due to applied load, various methods of settlement
analysis, static and dynamic bearing capacity of footings, bearing capacity of footings resting on layered soils
and footing on or near slopes, tilt, rotation and horizontal displacement of foundations subjected to eccentricinclined loads, seismic design of shallow foundations, analysis of raft foundations, circular and annular rafts,
structural design of shallow foundations, pile foundations load capacity and settlements, various methods of
analysis of laterally loaded Pile Foundations, piles subjected to dynamic loads, seismic design of pile
foundations, structural design of pile foundations, static and dynamic earth pressure theories, stability analysis
of retaining walls, reinforced earth wall design, machine foundations for reciprocating machines, impact type,
rotary machines, IS code provisions on foundations, codal provisions on structural and earthquake resistant
design of foundations.

2. Scope and Objective of the Course: The main goal of this course is to provide an in-depth understanding
regarding analysis and design of foundations systems for buildings, bridges substructure, industrial complexes,
ports, harbors, water tanks, storage tanks of industrial structure, transmission line towers etc. Complete design
of foundation systems considering geotechnical as well structural (R.C.C.) design of foundation systems will
be covered. Emphasis will be given on complete coverage of Indian code of practice for various type of
foundation. Latest advancement and practices followed in design office as per International code and standards
will be covered.
