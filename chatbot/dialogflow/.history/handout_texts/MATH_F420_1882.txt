SECOND SEMESTER 2020-21
COURSE HANDOUT

 

Date: 18.01.2021

In addition to part I (General Handout for all courses appended to the Time table) this portion gives further
specific details regarding the course.

Course No : MATH F420

Course Title : Mathematical Modelling
Instructor-in-C harge : BALRAM DUBEY
Instructor(s) :

Tutorial/Practical Instructors:

1. Course Description: Mathematical Modeling in Biology, Epidemiology, Model for Various Problems and Situation
Using ODE and PDE, Classic Models in Ecology and Evolutionary Biology, Equilibria and Stability Analysis, Dynamics of
Class-Structured Populations, Techniques for Analyzing Models.

2. Scope and Objective of the Course: The principal objective of this course is to familiarize students with the
theory of population and a basic understanding of mathematical modelling of a real-world problem. Students will gain
enough background to read theoretical population and evolutionary ecology literature, do simple modelling, and
springboard to more complex theory if desired. Students will develop techniques for understanding and analysing
simple, multivariate, and nonlinear models will be explored.
