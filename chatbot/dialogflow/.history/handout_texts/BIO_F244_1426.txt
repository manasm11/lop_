COURSE HANDOUT
Date: 18.01.2021

In addition to part I (General Handout for all courses appended to the Time table) this portion gives further
specific details regarding the course.

Course No : BIO F244

Course Title : Instrumental Methods of Analysis

Instructor-in-C harge : PANKAJ KUMAR SHARMA

Instructor(s) : PR Deepa

Practical Instructors : PR Deepa, Pankaj K Sharma, Monika Paul, Tripti Joshi, Sumit K Mandal,

Garima Singh, Anirudha K Sahu, Subhashree Chatterjee

1. Course Description: The advent of dedicated bio-instruments and computers has facilitated an explosive
progress in the instrumental methods of analysis in biology. Large number of data points, whether they are
physicochemical or biological, can be collected, stored, manipulated and analyzed with a high precision with
the help of modem sophisticated instruments having high sensitivity, selectivity, and extremely low detection
limit.

2. Scope and Objective of the Course: This course aims at providing a sufficient background of these
instruments, their handling and application, in the field of molecular biology, structural biology and
biotechnology.

3. Text Books: “Instrumental Methods of Analysis”, B. Sivasankar, Oxford Higher education 2012;
appropriate reading material will also be provided

4, Reference Books: R1. “Principles and Techniques of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology”, Wilson and
Walker, 7“ Ed.

Suggested Reading: 1. “Instrumental Methods of Analysis”, Williard et. al., CBS Publication, New Delhi, 7”
ed., 1998. 2. “Handbook of Analytical instruments”, R.S. Khandpur, Tata Mc Graw- Hill, 24 edition, 2006.

microscopy, FE-SEM, TEM, AFM, observe cell and cellular

Laser scanning Confocal Microscopy structures.

6. Conclusion L12: Concluding/summarizing the Students will understand
course the relevance and
combined usage of these
techniques in
research/industry

* Relevant research/review articles will be discussed to understand the applications of the techniques.

 

Lab Experiments:
The experiments will be classified in the following headings - spectrophotometry, chromatography,

molecular detection and/or microscopy. The specific experiments would be as follows (the order of
performance may be subject to change):

1: Purification and analysis of molecules by TLC

2: Purification and analysis of molecules by HPTLC

3: Purification and analysis of molecules by Gas chromatography

4: Purification and analysis of molecules by HPLC

9. Purification of molecules by Gel-filtration chromatography

6. Qualitative and quantitative analysis of given sample using UV-Vis spectrophotometry
7: Spectrofluorimetric estimation of quinine sulphate and fluorescence quenching of the same by
potassium iodide

8: Separation and characterization of proteins by SDS-PAGE

9: Analysis of the chemical structure of molecules using FTIR spectroscopy

10: Detection and characterization of cancer cells by flow cytometry

Note: Minor changes are possible subject to availability of chemicals/instruments.
