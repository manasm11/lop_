COURSE HANDOUT (PART II)
Date: 17/01/2021
In addition to Part-I (general handout for all courses appended to this time table) this portion gives further details
pertaining to the course.
Course No.: SS G515
Course Title: Data Warehousing
Instructor-in-charge: Dr. L. Rajya Lakshmi (rajya.lakshmi@ pilani.bits-pilani.ac.in)
Lab Instructor: Ms. Neha Choudhary (p20190409@pilani.bits-pilani.ac.in)
1. Objective and Scope
Corporate decision makers require access to all the organization’s data, wherever it is located. To provide
comprehensive analysis of the organization, its business, its requirements and any trends, require access to
not only the current data in the database but also to historical data. To facilitate this type of analysis, data
warehouses have been created to contain data drawn from several sources, maintained by different
departments of the organization. This course will involve an in-depth study of various concepts needed to
design, develop, and maintain a data warehouse. It also provides an introduction to end user access tools like
OLAP and reporting.
