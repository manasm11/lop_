SECOND SEMESTER 2020-21
COURSE HANDOUT
Date: 16.01.2021
In addition to part I (General Handout for all courses appended to the Time table) this portion gives further
specific details regarding the course.

Course No : CHEM G552
Course Title : Advanced Inorganic C hemistry
Instructor-in-C harge : BHARTI KHUNGAR

1. Course Description: Bonding: ionic, metallic and covalent bonding; The concepts of symmetry and theory
involved in group theory; Coordination chemistry: properties of d block elements, bonding in coordination chemistry,
Spectroscopy and magnetic properties of the coordination compounds, reaction, mechanism and kinetics involved in
coordination chemistry; Organometallic chemistry: synthesis, structure and bonding; Inorganic chains and cages.

2. Scope and Objective of the C ourse: The course aims at covering topics in advanced areas of inorganic chemistry,
with the broad classification of the entire subject into the domains viz., bonding, structure, coordination chemistry and
organometallic chemistry. Starting with the fundamental principles and their applications, the ultimate purpose of this
course is to provide a comprehensive survey involved in the different areas of inorganic chemistry before starting formal
research in any of the chemistry areas.
