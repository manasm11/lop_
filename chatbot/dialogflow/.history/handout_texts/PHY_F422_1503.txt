1. Course Description: (Since most students are not really familiar with Group Theory I provide abroad
outline of area. J ust as every book has a preface, this is a preface to the course).

Symmetries have often played an important role in the development of physics. Most conservation laws in
Physics owe it to the existence of continuous symmetries of physical systems. The word symmetry as it stands
is vague and must be defined precisely. The dynamical description of a physical system is often captured in
its Lagrangian. Whenever a physical system enjoys symmetry, there exists a class of solutions that offer
physically equivalent descriptions of the given dynamical situation. All the equivalent solutions in this class
are related by transformations called symmetry transformation. One can pose several questions here:

a) Do these transformations have an algebraic structure?

b) Does the algebraic structure have a life of its own? If yes, how rich and general is this algebraic
structure?

c) What is the relation of this algebraic structure to the space of solutions for the physical system?

d) Is the group theory only of utilitarian value to physics or it contributes something very fundamental to
physics?

e) Does it enrich something we already know?

A Group is a set of abstract objects that satisfy four axioms to qualify as a group. The theory of Groups in
itself is very rich and is indeed at the frontiers of pure and applied mathematics research. It is also very
powerful and can be profitably applied to many branches of science and engineering in general and to Physics
in particular. The algebraic structure of the symmetry transformations is a Group. It might seem odd that a set
of abstract objects qualified by four axioms can be of relevance in describing real-world physical objects. This
is where the power of representation theory comes into its own. The abstract group elements can be represented
by symmetry transformations via isomorphism (one-to-one mapping), and thus the full structural power of the
abstract group theory can be exploited to ‘see’ structure and pattern in the space of solutions to physical
problems. We can thus extract a wealth of information about the physical system even without having to find
the solution. Thus, a physicist is more interested in the matrix representations of the group of symmetry
transformations. Since these symmetry transformations act on the space of solutions, the theory of
representation itself is intimately connected to the linear vector spaces in general and the vector spaces with
the norm in particular. This explains the relation of the abstract elements of groups to the linear spaces of
solutions of a physical system.

To the extent that group theory is a mathematical framework for symmetries of physical systems, it strikes at
the very roots of why are things the way they are. Thus it is not just utilitarian in value but offers crucial and

fundamental insights. Going by our current understanding of the fundamental units of matter and energy, the
structure of the most fundamental Lagrangian at the currently accessible energy scales (of the order of 10
TeV ) is almost entirely dictated by the representations of the (a) spacetime symmetry group (Poincare group),
and (b) the direct product of some Unitary ‘internal' symmetry groups. At the risk of some oversimplifications, let me explain the last statement. In order to build any structure, an engineer needs three things
-- (i) A blueprint of the structure and the guiding design principles, (ii) Bricks (iii) Cement to glue the bricks.
For the particle physicist, the observed Universe is the realization of the blueprint we are trying to infer -- the
Lagrangian. The fields corresponding to the quanta of matter and energy are the building blocks of the
blueprint-Lagrangian. Put another way, all the fundamental particles (which are essentially quanta of field
excitations) are the different representations of the spacetime symmetry group called the Poincare Group. The
ultimate glue which binds these quanta are the fundamental interactions. These interactions are the
consequences of the broken and unbroken ‘internal' symmetry groups. That spacetime and internal symmetry
groups almost completely dictate the ‘fundamental Lagrangian' is a testimony to the power and economy of
Group Theory and its relevance to Particle Physics. I said ‘almost’ because the Lagrangian must comply with
an additional requirement that all observables must be finite. This is an admittedly ad hoc requirement and
hence the inverted quotes on the ‘fundamental Lagrangian’. The quantum field theory of fundamental particles
and their interactions with its symmetry paradigm is called the Standard Model of particle physics. It is an
almost fairy tale success story as it is constantly vindicated by experiments at the highest energy frontiers so
far. However, it is far from being a complete story for several reasons we will not get into here. We expect
that group theory will play a crucial role in our attempts to answer some of these puzzles.

Last but not the least, does group theory shed some light on things we already know? The answer is yes. Most
of the ‘special functions' in mathematical physics that are ubiquitous in classical and quantum physics
originate in the symmetries of the underlying problem. This is hardly surprising if one knows about the origins
of group theory. Group theory originated in the seminal work of Galois who used finite groups to solve the
algebraic equations of degree two, three, and four. He showed that the general polynomial equation of degree
greater than four could not be solved by radicals. Sophus Lie used this as a model and embarked upon an
ambitious program to solve or simplify ordinary and partial differential equations using the Group Theory as
a tool. The program is incomplete even after a century. Continuous groups are known as Lie Groups in his
honor. Lie groups also find rich applications in differential geometry. Manifolds are an abstraction of the idea
of a smooth surface and generalize the notion of an ordinary Euclidean space to a topological space that looks
like a Euclidean space in the local neighborhood of every point in it. Lie groups have the structure of a
manifold. Thus Lie groups are groups of symmetries of topological or geometric objects. Lie algebras can be
viewed as the “infinitesimal transformations” associated with the symmetries in the Lie group. There is a
geometric link between a Lie algebra and a Lie group. The Lie algebra can be viewed as a tangent space to
the Lie group at the identity. The tangent space and the Lie group are related by a map -- an exponential map.
The Lie algebra itself can be considered as a linearization of the Lie group. These observations connect the
theory of the Lie group to its rich applications in differential geometry.

2. Scope and Objective of the Course: This course is concemed with the rudiments of group theory and its
applications to problems in physics. After motivating the need and place of group theory in Physics, we will
first develop the rudiments of abstract group theory and some results of fundamental importance. We shall

do so within the context of finite groups but the results shall be equally applicable to continuous Lie groups.
Groups mainly enter the domain of physics through their representations as matrix groups. After developing
the necessary background concerning Hilbert spaces and operators, we shall dwell upon the representation

theory for finite groups. We shall prove two lemmas due to Schur as well as the great orthogonality theorem,

paving the way for the regular representations, the irreducible representations, and the characters of a
representation. We will then discuss the continuous Lie groups such as SO(2), SO(3), Lorentz group, and
SU(2). We will also discuss Lie algebra and representations of a Lie group. All along we will emphasize the
applications to physical situations in general and to Quantum Mechanics in particular.
