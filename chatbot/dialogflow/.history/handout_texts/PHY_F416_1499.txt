1. Course Description:

Soft matter or soft condensed matter is a subfield of condensed matter comprising a variety of physical systems that are
deformed or structurally altered by thermal or mechanical stress of the magnitude of thermal fluctuations. They include
liquids, colloids, polymers, foams, gels, granular materials, liquid crystals, and biomolecules. These materials share an
essential characteristic feature in that predominant physical behaviors occur at an energy scale comparable with room
temperature thermal energy. At these temperatures, quantum aspects are less significant.

In this course, our aim would be to understand the structure, properties, and dynamics of the soft matter. What is the
order of forces and times scales that affect the overall behaviour of this class of matter?

2. Scope and Objective of the C ourse:
e Develop familiarity with the basics of soft condensed matter.
e To develop an understanding about the forces and order of thermal fluctuations in soft matter.
e Why some part of matter is classified as soft matter?

3. Textbooks:
1. Soft Matter Physics, Masao Doi, Oxford University Press, I edition (2013)
2. Soft Condensed Matter, R.A.L. Jones, Oxford University Press, I edition (2002)
