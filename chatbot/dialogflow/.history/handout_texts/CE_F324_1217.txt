1. Course Description: It is needless to say that the present digital world has forced students to use commercial
software that involve numerical methods, quite often. The proper and justified use of these programs is only
possible if knowledge of the basic theory underlying the methods have been sufficiently developed among the
students. This course is framed to provide a sufficient background to numerical methods required to solve
engineering problems, especially intended to focus on various civil engineering and natural problems.

2. Scope and Objective of the Course: We know that various scientific phenomena whether natural or manmade, can be modeled using mathematical expressions which may be of simple algebra to complex algebra, simple
to complex ODE’s, simple to complex PDE’s etc. To represent these phenomena, one need to solve these
mathematical models by analytical, graphical, or approximate methods. Numerical Analysis is the approach that
deals with the approximate solution methodologies of various mathematical models. This course introduces the core
concepts of error estimation and accuracy of numerical solutions. It then discuss the methods of solution of linear
and non-linear equations. Both direct and iterative solution methods are discussed. Then ordinary differential
equations frequently used in engineering applications are introduced and its various solution methodologies are
discussed. Next the numerical solutions of partial differential equations which are again quite common forms of
mathematical models for many natural problems, are discussed, along with a brief review of different category of
partial differential equations and well known analytical techniques for the solutions of some of the simple models
and finally discussing the necessity of numerical methods. Finite difference operators are introduced and used to
solve typical initial and boundary value problems of engineering interests.
