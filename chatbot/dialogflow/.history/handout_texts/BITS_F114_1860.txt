SECOND SEMESTER 2020-21
COURSE HANDOUT
Date: 14.03.2021

In addition to Part I (General Handout for all courses appended to the time table) this portion gives
further specific details regarding the course.

Course Number : BITS F114

Course Title : General Mathematics II

Instructor-In charge :TRILOK MATHUR

. Course Description:
I. Polar coordinates, Function of several variables, multiple integrals, V ector valued functions.
II. Complex functions and their analyticity.
III. First order and second order ordinary differential equations, Laplace transformations and how to
solve initial value problems of ordinary differential equations.

NO

. Scope and Objective of the C ourse:

The course is for Pharmacy students keeping in mind the importance of Calculus and Differential
equations in every branch of Science and Engineering. Functions of several variables appear more
frequently in scientific problem than functions of a single variable. Their derivatives are more interesting
because of the different ways in which the variables can interact, while differential equations of both
homogeneous and non- homogeneous also plays a vital role in Engineering and Sciences.
