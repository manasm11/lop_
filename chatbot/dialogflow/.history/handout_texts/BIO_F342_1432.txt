1. Course Description: Introduction to immune system, cell mediated and humoral
imunity, immunity to infectious diseases, immune mechanisms involved in cancer and
transplantation immunology.

2. Scope and objective of the course: This course has been designed to provide an insight
in the concept and latest developments in immunology. Emphasis will be given on
developing a molecular, cellular and clinical perspective of the area.
