COURSE HANDOUT

 

Date: 17.01.2021

In addition to part I (General Handout for all courses appended to the Time table) this portion gives further
specific details regarding the course.

Course No : CHEM F343
Course Title : Inorganic Chemistry III
Instructor-in-C harge : AJAY KUMAR SAH

Tutorial/Practical Instructors: Ajay Kumar Sah
1. Course Description:

This course encompasses several aspects of the elements of periodic table encountered in inorganic chemistry typically
in numerous application/ functional areas such as, life processes, modern day-to-day living, medical and fine chemical
applications etc. Some important key- phrases are as follows,

Bio-inorganic chemistry; metalloenzymes; metalloproteins; role of alkali and alkaline earth metal ions, iron, copper,
zinc, molybdenum etc. in life processes; metals in medicine; metal deficiency and toxicity aspects (mercury, cadmium,
lead, beryllium, selenium and arsenic etc.); metals used in diagnosis and chemotherapy; electronic, magnetic and
photonic materials; emerging research topics in inorganic chemistry, such as catalysis, inorganic polymers,
nanomaterials and hybrid materials.

2. Scope and Objective of the Course: The most important objective of the course is to acquire knowledge and
understanding about the roles and importance of the different elements (majorly metals) in life processes, medicinal
purposes and augmenting the quality of life of mankind by breakthrough advancements in human civilization. As an
integral part of learning the applications of inorganic chemistry, this course will be utilizing the knowledge and
understanding gained in the foundation courses of General Chemistry, IC-I and IC-II for probing deeper in to the
chemistry of biological systems, chemistry of modern materials, chemistry in industrial processes for commodity and
fine chemicals, medicines, sensors etc. On successful completion of the course, the following learning objectives will
be fulfilled

Introduction to bioinorganic chemistry

11) Understanding the role of metal centers in biological systems (typically redox systems)

ili) Metals in medical applications, toxicity and deficiency aspects

iv) Introduction to electronic, photonic and magnetic materials involving inorganic chemistry
Inorganic chemistry involved in industrial applications such as polymer synthesis, catalysis etc.

Vi) Exposure to the emerging research areas of functional materials chemistry including inorganic polymers,
nanomaterials, hybrid materials etc.
