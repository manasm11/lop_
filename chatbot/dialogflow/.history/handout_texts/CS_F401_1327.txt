9, Make-up Policy: Make-up may be granted only in genuine cases if student has given prior information of his/her
reason of absence from the regular examination/test.

10. Note (if any): If the marks- histogram emerges as not skewed, then a student getting marks, say marks m
out of maximum marks, MM, such that (MM*m/Acut) < 15*(MM/100), where Acut is the cutoff
(recommended as per the histogram) for A grade, may be recommended to be reported an NC.
