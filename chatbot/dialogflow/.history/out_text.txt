Scope and Objectives

This course will give you a breakdown of the applications, communications protocols, and network services
that make a computer network work. We will closely follow the top down approach to computer networking
as given in the textbook, which will enable you to understand the most visible part i.e. the applications, and
then seeing, progressively, how each layer is supported by the next layer down. Most of the time our example
network will be the Internet. Also, a chapter on wireless and mobile networks will be covered as currently
users access the Internet from offices, from homes, while on move, and from public places wirelessly. There
will be laboratory sessions to provide practical skills using a network simulator (NS-2), a network protocol
analyzer tool (Wireshark) and TCP/IP socket programming.
