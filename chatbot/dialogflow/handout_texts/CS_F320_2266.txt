Catalog Description

Data Science is the study of the generalizable extraction of knowledge from data. Unprecedented
advances in digital technology during the second half of the 20th century and the data explosion
that ensued in the 21% century is transforming the way we do science, social science, and
engineering. Application of data science cut across all verticals. A data scientist requires an
integrated skill set spanning mathematics, probability and statistics, optimization, and branches of
computer science like databases, machine learning etc. The course aims at providing the
mathematical and computer science foundations required for data science.

Labs. on R: No structured lab. sessions, but students will be provided with Lab. sheets
on important topics.

Notices: All notices will be uploaded on NALANDA only.

Chamber Consultation Session: Online session once a week (M-10). Interested
student(s) need to inform aprioni if a session is required.

Makeup Policy: To be granted only in case of serious illness or emergency.

Email Policy: Communication through email is highly discouraged. If you want to
discuss anything, attend the chamber consultation session. Academic queries/doubts can
be posted on NALANDA (a discussion forum will be created)

Plagiarism Policy: If any student is found involved in any kind of plagiarism in any of
the evaluation components, the matter will be directly reported to the Examination
Committee.

NC Policy: Students securing 10% or less marks will get an NC grade. Students in the
[10-15%] bracket are also likely to get NC.
