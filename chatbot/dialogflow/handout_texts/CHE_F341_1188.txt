In addition to part I (General Handout for all courses appended to the Time table) this portion gives further
specific details regarding the course.

Course No : CHE F341

Course Title : Chemical Engineering Laboratory - II
Instructor-in-C harge : BHANU VARDHAN REDDY KUNCHARAM
Practical Instructor(s) : Hare Krishna Mohanta, Arkaprovo Ghosal

1. Course Description:

This course aims to help students gain practical experience using laboratory-scale experiments to supplement theory
courses taught in classroom with major focus on chosen experiments from Kinetics and Reactor Design, Process
Dynamics and Control and Separation Processes — 2. Students will collect and analyze experimental data using
theoretical principles related to relevant courses already covered in previous Semesters.

2. Scope and Objective of the Course:

The main objective of this course is to educate students with different aspects of chemical engineering experiments. The
students will carry out experiments that will expose them to experimental methods and integrate theoretical knowledge
and concept to practical experience. Students will also learn the operation of some scientific equipment for performing
experiments.

7. Software & Technology:

e Students are expected to acquire a computer with desired hardware, software capable of handling
online classes. High-speed internet may be required for streaming the lab sessions.

e Online lab sessions will be conducted via Google Meet, and all relevant material will be posted on
Google Classroom.

9. Evaluative Components and Associated Policies:

9.1. Lab Report Submission:

e A group of 5-6 students are formed at the beginning of the semester.

e All members of each group will unanimously identify a group leader who would be responsible for
communication. Please note that the group leader is just for facilitation purpose and by no means
should be considered authoritative. All group members shall be deemed equal.

e On the day of conduction of the online lab experiment, a datasheet with experimental results will be
sent to the identified group leader. The identified group leader will be responsible for coordinating
among group members for completion of lab records.

e Lab record includes sample calculation and calculation table (1 mark), graph(s) and data
visualization (1 mark), discussion and critical data analysis (2 marks), final conclusion (1 mark). All
group members will participate in this activity and contribute in the lab record writing.

e Itis expected that you will submit your lab report as a single pdf file. Please make sure you write
names and IDs of all group members on top of each page with the group leader's name highlighted.
Y ou are free to use any platforms/software for report generation, data analysis and visualization. Use
of technology is encouraged. Handwritten and scanned reports will not be accepted.

e The lab report will be due one week after completing the experiment (all dates are marked out in the
schedule). The designated group leader will submit the report online in the google classroom. It is the
responsibility of all group members to ensure the report is completed and submitted within the
deadline.
Late Submission Policy: As highlighted in the schedule, the lab records will be due at 1:59 pm a week
after the experiment's conduction. If you miss this deadline, you can still submit your lab record with
the procedure described above; however, in this case, there will be a 50% penalty. This late submission
policy is applicable for only one more week following the original deadline. However, if your group
failed to submit a lab report even after two weeks of original conduction of the experiment, your group
will be awarded zero points for that experiment. Each group member's collective responsibility is to
make sure their group leader submits the lab report on time. No exceptions will be entertained in this
regard. The decision of the I/C will be final in all such cases.

Plagiarism: As highlighted, you are requested to submit a professional quality digital lab report in a

single pdf file. It is expected that each group will submit their original lab report. Plagiarism might be

construed as academic dishonesty, and your submitted lab reports might be subjected through
plagiarism detection software(s). W hile we understand there might be a few technical phrases common
in all the lab reports, there will not be any penalty for similarity up to 20%. However, 50% marks
deduction for both the groups whose reports are 20%-40% similar. If found more than 40% similarity,
zero marks will be awarded for both the groups. The decision of the I/C will be final in all such cases.

e Since itis a kind of pseudo-flipped mode of teaching/learning, and mainly since all the lab procedures
will be made available, there will not be any lab makeup. If students miss a particular lab-session, they
are encouraged to go through the recorded lab video in their own time and catch-up with their group
members to complete lab reports. They may also consult instructor(s) in the online consultation hours
announced or during the next regular lab session.

9.2. Quizzes:

@ Quizzes are part of the continuous evaluation process and designed as per the latest guidelines from

AUGSD.

e Total 18 quizzes of 6 marks each will be conducted during the regular lab hours as per dates announced
in the schedule. These quizzes will be conducted online.
Out of 18, the best 15 will be taken for final evaluation.
Quizzes are timed and closed book. Each student will attempt the quiz individually without consulting
his/her group or classmates. Any cheating/coordination/unfair means will be reported to AUGSD.
Makeup is only provided for genuine cases. Prior permission has to be taken from the I/C. The decision
of the I/C will be final in all such cases.

9.3. Viva-voce:
e Vivais an integral part of this course and will be conducted during the mid-semester (30 marks) and
end-semester (45 marks).
e Mid-semester viva will be based on experiments 1 to 8 while end-semester viva will be based on
experiments 9 to 18.

e Viva will be conducted online via Google Meet with your group members which you will have selected
as described in 9.1.

e Viva is a closed book, and you will be tested on the clarity of concepts related to the experiments
conducted, background theory, experimental procedure, calculations, data analysis and applications.

e A panel of all instructors will take the viva and give individual marks. Average of those marks would
then be taken and communicated to you. We will not be able to give you individual break-down marks.

e Only genuine requests for viva makeup backed by paperwork/evidence will be entertained. Prior email
permission would be necessary. The decision of the I/C will be final in all such cases.

9.4. Comprehensive Examination:
e There would be a written comprehensive examination for 45 marks.
e The syllabus for comprehensive examination will be all experiments.

7. Chamber Consultation Hour:
To be announced

8. Notices:

All notices will be posted in Google Classroom. Google Class room is available for BITS email address only,
no access is provided for other emails.

9. Makeup Policy:

Makeup for selected evaluation components will be granted for genuine cases only. Except for an emergency,
for all other cases, prior permission of the I/C is mandatory. The decision of the I/C will be final in all the
cases.

10. Note (if any):
Any change(s) in the course handout will be communicated in the regular class or through email.
