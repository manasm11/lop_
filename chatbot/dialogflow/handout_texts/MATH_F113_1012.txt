Course Description:

Probability and statistics form an exciting sub-area of mathematical science. They have relevance in
almost all disciplines concerned with data and uncertainty. While probability theory deals with many
real life problems, which either inherently involve the chance phenomena or describe the behavior of a
system, statistical analysis is built up on the concepts of probability theory. Interpretation of a process in
many engineering aspects often depends on the ideas of probability and statistics coupled with
computational aspects. In this fundamental course, the aim is to build up skills in understanding the
concepts of random variable, probability distribution, statistical inference, regression and correlation
among several other related topics.

Scope and Objective of the C ourse:

The primary objective of this course is to familiarize students with the fundamental concepts and
techniques of probability theory and statistical analysis.
