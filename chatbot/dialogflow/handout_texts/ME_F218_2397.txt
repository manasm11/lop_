In addition to part -| (General Handout for all courses appended to the time table) this portion
gives further specific details regarding the course.

LPTU : 2012
Course No. : ME F218
Course Title : Advanced Mechanics of Solids

Instructor-in-charge : Prof. M. S. DASGUPTA
Tutorial Instructors :JjS Rathore, Gaurav Watts, Venkatesh Kadbur Prabhakar Rao

1. Course Description: The course starts with generalized Hooke’s law and three dimensional stress
strain relations putting emphasis on Materials-Mechanics linkage to elucidate mechanical properties of
materials. It also includes Energy methods; Torsion of non-circular members; Shear center and
Asymmetrical bending of beams; Curved beams; Thick cylinders.

2. Scope and Objective of the Course: The course deals with in-depth analysis of some advanced
topics in Mechanics of Solids, necessary for Mechanical Engineering students, beyond what is
covered in the common course Mechanics of Solids.
