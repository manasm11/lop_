In addition to part I (General Handout for all courses appended to the time table) this portion gives further specific details
regarding the course.

Course Number : BITS F452

Course Title : Blockchain T echnology

Instructor-in-charge : Dr. Amit Dua (amit.dua@ pilani.bits-pilani.ac.in)

Instructor(s) : Dr. Ashutosh Bhatia (ashutosh.bhatia@ pilani.bits-pilani.ac.in)

1. Scope and Objective of the course

The recent developments in the Blockchain have led to its pervasive influence, especially in Cryptocurrencies,
Insurance, Energy and Trade, Finance, Healthcare, Supply Chain, and any other critical fields. With the
widespread acceptance of cryptocurrencies and Blockchain as its core technology, both academia, and industry,
are seeing enormous opportunities. Blockchain technology can be used to develop solutions involving noneconomic transactions. Some of them include IoT, distributed cloud storage, supply chain management,
medicine, ownership, and royalty distribution, and decentralized autonomous organizations. This course provides
a comprehensive understating of essential concepts involved in blockchain technology and its applications. The
course provides fundamental understandings of Blockchain architecture, cryptocurrencies (especially Bitcoin),
Smart contracts, Consensus algorithms, Permissionless and Permissioned blockchains, and the development of
Decentralized A pplication using Ethereum and Hyperledger. The registered students will become confident in
understanding the existing applications and develop complete end-to-end solutions to the practical problems using
the Blockchain concepts. The case studies discussions and projects enable students to assimilate the concepts
better. Finally, the course will also shed some light on the current advancements in the Blockchain and few topics
beyond blockchains such as DAG-based distributed ledgers.
The objectives of the course are

1. To provide acomprehensive understating of foundational and other essential concepts involved in

blockchain technology.
2. To introduce the concept and development process of decentralized applications pertaining to number of
verticals such as finance, supply chain, governance etc. through both theory and practical.
3. To introduce the current advancements in the Blockchain and few topics beyond blockchains such as

DAG-based distributed ledgers.
