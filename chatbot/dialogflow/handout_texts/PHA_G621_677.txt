SECOND SEMESTER 2020-21
COURSE HANDOUT
Date: 12.03.2021

In addition to part | (General Handout for all courses appended to the Time table) this portion gives further specific
details regarding the course.

Course No : PHA G621

Course Title : ADVANCED MEDICINAL CHEMISTRY
Instructor-in-Charge : HEMANT R JADHAV

Practical Instructors : Amritansh Bhanot, Amit Sharma, Prashant Auti

1. Scope and Objective of the Course:

This course is designed to familiarize the students to improve their knowledge of medicinal chemistry by learning
how to take a rational, physical, chemical, organic approach to drug design and drug development in relation to the
chemistry of drug action. Emphasis is also made on planning and designing of molecules to enhance their medicinal
activity.

*Continuous assessment will be based on theory covered and will be in terms of home assignments, quizzes,
projects, laboratory, viva-voce, presentations, etc. Exact topics and number will be announced in class.

** It is strongly advised that all students prepare their own notes and relevant information from lectures, text and
reference books as given in handouts. Only notes and books (given in hand out) will be allowed for consultation
during open book assessments. Photocopies of any material, written or printed will not be permitted due to
copyright issues.

*** Recent developments in the area/topic will be discussed in class and hence some information may differ from
the information in text or reference material. Such discussions held in class will be considered as primary source of
information in assessments and hence students are expected to take note.

6. Chamber Consultation Hour: Room No. 3170 X, Time to be announced in class.

7. Notices: Notices concerning the course will be displayed on the Pharmacy Group Notice Board only.

8. Make-up Policy: Generally make-up will be considered for regular students only. It is solely dependent on the
‘genuineness’ of the circumstances. The make-up application should be personally given to instructor-in-charge.

9. Note (if any): Students are advised to read, collect additional information on the above mentioned topics. All
evaluation components are equally important, irrespective of weightage. Hence, students failing to attend scheduled
classes, or absenting themselves in one or many of the evaluation components, may become ineligible for obtaining
a valid grade at the end of the semester. Attendance in all lectures and assessments are equally important as they
are all integral components of learning, irrespective of weightage and may be taken into consideration during
grading.
