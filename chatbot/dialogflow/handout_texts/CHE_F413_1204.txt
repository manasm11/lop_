Course Handout (Part-lIl)
Date: 14/01/2021

In addition to Part | (General Handout for all courses appended to the Time Table), this portion gives
further specific details regarding the course.

Course No. : CHE F413
Course Title : Process Plant Safety
Instructor-in-Charge : P C Sande

1. Course Description:

Role of safety in society; Engineering aspects of process plant safety; Chemical hazards and worker
safety; Hazardous properties of chemicals; Safety aspects in site selection and plant layout; Design
and inspection of pressure vessels; Storage, handling and transportation of hazardous chemicals;
Risk assessment methods; Toxic release; Fire and Explosions; Safety audit; Emergency planning and
disaster management; Case studies.

2. Scope and Objective:

e This course deals with various safety aspects encountered in the chemical process industries.

e The primary objective of this course is teach important technical fundamentals for proper
assessment of the risks posed by hazardous chemicals and continuous care during their
manufacturing, processing, treatment, packaging, storage, transportation, use and sale.

e We will apply the concepts and principles learned in the course to analyze numerous cases
of ‘real world’ chemical process incidents/accidents.

e This course provides guidance for developing industrial safety procedures and equipment
designs.

Course Policy:

e Mid Semester Test and Comprehensive Examination are according to the Evaluation Scheme
given in the Course Handout.

e If the student is unable to appear for the Regular Test/Examination due to genuine
exigencies, the student must refer to the procedure for applying for Make-up
Test/Examination (see Academic Regulations-2015). Final decision rests with IC.

Project reports and Presentation:

e The deadline for the report and date of presentations: to be announced in the class.
e Further guidance will be provided during the lectures.

Pedagogy: mode is adapted for online platform and might include film or video clips/ role play
or dialogue/ case studies/ breakout sessions etc.
