Course Title: Numerical Methods for Chemical Engineers
Instructor-in-C harge: PRATIK N SHETH

Instructor(s) : Pratik N Sheth

Tutorial/Practical Instructors: Ajay Kumar Pani and Ajita Neogi

1. Course Description:

Introduction to mathematical modeling and engineering problem solving, Use of software packages and
programming, Errors and approximations including error propagation and numerical error, Roots of equations:
Linear algebraic equations, 1-D and multi-dimensional unconstrained optimization including gradient
methods, Linear programming, Non-linear constrained optimization, Optimization with packages, Least
Squares Regression including quantification of error, Polynomial regression, Lagrange, inverse and spline
interpolation and Fourier approximation, Engineering applications, Numerical differentiation and integration,
Ordinary differential equations, Partial differential equations, Engineering applications.

2. Scope and Objective of the C ourse:
several chemical engineering problems involve finding roots in a higher order equation, solving simultaneous

set of algebraic equations, solving differential equations etc. Quite often, these equations are not amenable to
analytical solutions. In such cases, use of numerical methods is necessary which then provides a way for the
engineer to translate the language of mathematics and physics into information that may use to make
engineering decisions. This course will provide students with an exposure to numerical techniques which can
be used to solve algebraic and differential equations of varying complexity. Numerical methods for
differentiation, integration and curve fitting techniques will also be covered. Strong emphasis will be placed
on problem solving based on case studies in engineering. Specific focus in case studies will be application of
numerical techniques and scientific computing to the practice of chemical engineering. The role of computers
and software along with identification, quantification and minimization of errors involved in numerical
analysis will also be highlighted.
