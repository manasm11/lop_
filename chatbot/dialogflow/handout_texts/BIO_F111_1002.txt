Second Semester 2020-21
Course Handout (Part IT)
Date: 18 January 2021

In addition to Part-I (General Handout for all courses) printed on page 1 of the timetable book, this
portion gives further specific details regarding the course.

Course Number : BIO F111
Course Title : GENERAL BIOLOGY

Note: This is a special offering for the backlog students.

Instructor-in-Charge : Manoj Kannan (manojkannan@pilani.bits-pilani.ac.in)

Mukul Joshi (mukul.joshi@pilani.bits-pilani.ac.in)

Tutorial Instructor: Harshita Sharma (p20170409 @pilani.bits-pilani.ac.in)

 

1. Course Description:
Living systems and their properties; classification of organisms; biochemistry and cell biology;
primary biochemical/metabolic pathways; introductory genetics; biotechnology and _ its
applications; basic human physiological processes.

2. Scope and Objective of the Course:

The course is aimed to provide a broad introduction to the major principles and topics in biology.
The relationship of the living organism with its environment at the molecular level is highlighted in
line with modern research in biological sciences. By the end of the course, the student would have
gained an overall understanding of the essential aspects of biology — both as a basic science and as
a branch with wide-ranging applications in industry, medicine and human health. It is also
expected that using the acquired knowledge, he/she would be able to devise/suggest strategies to
solve some of the imminent problems faced by mankind and the world at large.

7. Academic Conduct Policy:
It is expected that all students follow the highest standard of academic practice when participating
in any evaluation component. Plagiarism material of any sort in evaluation components will dealt
strictly and any such misconduct in this line will likely lead to awarding of no marks for such
evaluation component. Having a zero-tolerance for academic dishonesty, any case of misconduct,
however minor, will be dealt appropriately.

 

8. Grading Policy:
Award of grades would be guided by the histogram of marks and course average. If a student
absents himself/herself in any component (listed in the Evaluation Scheme), his/her performance
in the course may be reported as ‘NC’ (Not Cleared).

9. Make-up Policy:
If a student misses any of the evaluation components due to a genuine reason (serious medical
causes leading to hospitalization, personal/family emergencies) there exists a provision to apply
for make-up*. Prior permission must be taken from the Instructor-in-Charge, before applying. The
decision to grant make-up or not is taken by the instructor team and shall be final.
