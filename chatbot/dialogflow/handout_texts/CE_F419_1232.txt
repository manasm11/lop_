SECOND SEMESTER 2020-21
COURSE HANDOUT
Date: 15-1-2021

In addition to part I (General Handout for all courses appended to the Time table) this portion gives further
specific details regarding the course.

Course No : CE F419
Course Title : Geotechnical Earthquake Engineering & Machine Foundation
Instructor-in-C harge : Prof. Kamalesh Kumar

1. Course Description: Basics of Geotechnical Earthquake Engineering and foundations supporting
vibratory machines will be covered.

2. Scope and Objective of the Course: Earthquake resistant geotechnical construction has become an
important design aspect recently. Course includes discussion on introduction to geotechnical earthquake
engineering, earthquakes, dynamic soil properties, site seismicity, seismic soil response and design
earthquake. Concept of liquefaction will be covered in detail. Earthquake resistant design of shallow
foundation, earthquake resistant design of deep foundation, slope stability analysis for earthquakes and
retaining wall analysis for earthquake will also be covered. Later part of course will be on machine
foundations. Methods of analysis of block foundations, soil spring constants, determination of soil spring
constants, damping, vertical vibration, rocking vibration, pure sliding and yawing of block foundations will
be covered in this context.
