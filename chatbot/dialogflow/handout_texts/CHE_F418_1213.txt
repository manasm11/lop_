further specific details regarding the course.

Course No. : CHE F418
Course Title : Modelling and Simulation in C hemical Engineering
Instructor-in-C harge : SRINIVAS APPARI

1. Course Description

The Modelling and Simulation of Chemical Engineering processes is a subject of major importance for the
knowledge of unitary processes of transport and kinetics. Basically, it deals with three aspects, namely;
modelling of chemical engineering processes, parameter estimations and application of numerical methods for
solution of models. In this course, first chapter is devoted to introduction of the course and discusses the process
modelling and need of simulation. Subsequently it follows the parameter estimation, tools of simulation,
development of models, classification of models, unit models of unit process, models of mass transfer
equipment, heat transfer equipment, reactors, and application of numerical methods for solutions of models.

2. Scope & Objective

This course is designed to have detailed understanding of process simulation, tools of simulation, parameter
estimation, models and classification of models, alternate classification of models, mathematical modelling.
The primary objective of the course is to formulate mathematical models for mass transfer, heat transfer, fluid
flow operations and reaction engineering aspects. It also caters the role of simulations and simulators in
industrial applications by covering in-depth knowledge of modular & equation-solving approaches in
simulation, decomposition of network and convergence promotion.
