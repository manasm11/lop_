Course Title: Heat Transfer

Instructor-in-charge: P.SRINIVASAN;

Tutorial Instructors: Aneesh.A.M, A.R.Harikrishnan, Ranganayukulu. C

Practical Instructors: Leo Daniel, Diplesh Gautam, Ashish Khare Devendra Kumar Vishwakarma.

1.C ourse Description:

Fundamental concepts of heat transfer; steady state and unsteady state heat conduction; analytical and
empirical relations for forced and free convection heat transfer; heat exchangers; boiling and
condensation; heat transfer by radiation; associated laboratory.

2. Scope and Objective of the C ourse:

This course is designed to make the students familiarize with the concepts of heat transfer and its
applications. As a part of this course, students have to do the experiments to correlate theoretical
knowledge with the experimental results
