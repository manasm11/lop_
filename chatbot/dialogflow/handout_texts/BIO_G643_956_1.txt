SECOND SEMESTER 2020-21
COURSE HANDOUT
Date: 10.03.2021

In addition to part I (General Handout for all courses appended to the time table) this portion gives further
specific details regarding the course.

Course No : BIO G643

Course Title : Plant Biotechnology
Instructor-in-C harge : JITENDRA PANWAR

Instructor : Mukul J oshi

Practical Instructors : Mukul J oshi, Swarnima, Shobham

1. Course Description: Plant genetic systems and their implications for plant transformation and protein
targeting, Cell and tissue culture, techniques for plant transformation; Agrobacterium mediated and biolistic
methods, vectors for plant transformation, genetic manipulation of herbicide tolerance, pest resistance, disease
resistance, stress tolerance, improvement of crop yield and quality, Public concerns of GM crops.

2. Scope and Objective of the C ourse:
This course will enable students to increase their knowledge in recent advances in plant cell and tissue culture
techniques both theoretically and practically. It will provide an insight to the theory and practice of plant
biotechnology with emphasis on the genetic engineering of plants to produce new products for medicine,
industry and agriculture.
