Course No. >: MF F220

Course Title : Metrology and Quality Assurance
Instructor-in-Charge : Tribeni Roy

Tutorial Instructor : Radha Raman Mishra

Laboratory Instructor : Girish Kant Garg

1. Course Description:

Metrology and Quality Assurance are the tools which equip engineeres to ensure a defect free and precise
product during its production. The present course covers various aspects of Metrology and Quality
Assurance such as importance of metrology, calibration, limits fits and tolerances, design of gauges, linear
and angular measurement, inspection of surface quality, features inspection, coordinate measuring
systems, application of vision, interferometry, laser, and other non-contact measuring systems, various case
studies on measurement systems used for automated production systems; quality management: practices,
tools and standards, statistical techniques in quality control, statistical process control using control charts,
control charts for attributes, and variables, process capability analysis, measurement system analysis,
acceptance sampling plan, reliability assessment of systems and use of commercial software for statistical
quality control (SQC)

2. Scope and Objective of the Course:

This course is designed to impart knowledge on the basics of metrology and quality assurance (QA).
Metrology bridges the gap between designer’s vision and the actual product. Knowledge of QA or quality
control will enable the students to statistically determine the number of defects in manufactured products
and ways to avoid them. This course provides laboratory demonstration of various metrology tools for
inspection and application of statistical tools for problem solving.
