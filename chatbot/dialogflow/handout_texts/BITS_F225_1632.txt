specific details regarding the course.

Course No > BITS F225

Course Title : Environmental Studies

Instructor-in-C harge : Smita Raghuvanshi

Instructor(s) : Arvind K Sharma, B Vani, G Muthukumar, Madhurima Das, Tanu
Shukla, Rajneesh C houbisa, Harikrishnan G opinadhan Nair, Sunita
Raina

1. Course Description: Environment, human population, and industrialization; natural resources and the
impact of man-made activities on them; structure and function of ecosystem, population ecology, biodiversity
and its conservation, environmental pollution, social issues and the environment, and environmental impact
assessment.

2. Scope and Objective of the Course: The United Nations Conference on Environment and Development
(UNCED) held in Rio De Janero in 1992, the 1994 conference on United Nations Framework Convention on
Climate Change (UNFCCC), and a very recent 2015 Paris Agreement have created awareness among the
people around the globe about the deteriorating condition of Earth’s environment. It has warned us not to be
ignorant of the environmental issues. In lieu of the situation, the Hon’ble Supreme Court directed the UGC
to introduce a basic course on environment for undergraduate students in India.

The course is designed to cover all aspects of environment [Ecological including biotic (flora- fauna) and
abiotic (air, water, soil & geography), social, economic and aesthetical]. The course is of interdisciplinary
nature dealing with social, biological & engineering aspects of environment. The role of biotic and abiotic
factors in the functioning of the environment, the impact of anthropogenic activities on the environment,
different environmental pollutants, its impact and management strategies; and ecological, socio-political and
economic issues will be discussed with appropriate real-life examples and case studies. The course would also
provide insight into practical solutions to different environmental issues. Finally, important concepts of
environmental impact assessment from all the above mentioned sources would be dealt with. The interested
students can take the leamings forward from this point and enrich themselves further by doing other
electives/projects in these areas.
