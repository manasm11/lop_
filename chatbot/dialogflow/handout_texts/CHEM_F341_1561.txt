1. Course Description: The main aim of the course is to build laboratory skills and to provide hands-on experience
of various theories by exposure to different kind of experiments covering principles and theories in chemistry. The
course folds in experiments with macroscopic methodologies, validation of various chemical theories, as well as
electronic structure calculation using sophisticated models. The course is normally available to students of third year
and higher levels.

2. Scope and Objective of the Course: The main objective of the course is to expose the students to various
experimental methods commonly used in Chemistry. The students will carry out a set of experiments in the areas of
analytical chemistry, inorganic chemistry, nano-chemistry, electrochemistry, physical chemistry, and
theoretical/computational chemistry.

Techniques to experience: Includes but not limited to Inorganic synthesis techniques, Separation techniques based on
phasic composition, Analytical techniques such as UV-Vis spectroscopy, FTIR spectroscopy, Spectrofluorimetry,
Viscometry, Potentiometry, Conductometry, Gravimetry, Titremetry, Basic computation techniques towards
understanding of electronic structure and molecular dynamics simulation.
