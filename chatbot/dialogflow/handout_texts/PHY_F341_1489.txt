1. Course Description

The course covers the physical aspects of the matter in condensed state from an atomistic view point. It is
an introduction to the solid state physics, begins with the basic concepts of crystallography along with
lattice vibrations and related thermal properties, energy states and electronic band theory, free electron
models and related electrical properties and magnetism. This course also dealt with various important class
of materials such as semiconductors, insulators and superconductors. Thus overall topics covered here
includes the structural, thermal and electrical properties of matter.

2. Scope and Objectives

To provide physical as well as mathematical understanding of various phenomena in solid state physics
associated mainly with crystalline solids

Lay the foundation for a working and understanding of solids through fundamental theoretical
concepts.
