In addition to Part | (General Handout for all courses appended to the time-table) this portion gives

further specific details regarding the course.

Course No. : BITS F415
Course Title : Introduction to MEMS
Instructor-in-charge : SACHIN U BELGAMWAR

1. Scope and Objective of the Course:

The course introduces the basic concepts in MEMS (Micro Electromechanical Systems) with a view to
address a class of students from science and engineering disciplines. The discussion on topics like
MEMS design, Microfabrication, Microfluidics, Microrobotics and Microsensors have been structured
in the course plan. The objective of the course is to equip the students from various aspects and with
basic knowledge of the area of MEMS.
