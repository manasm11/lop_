COURSE HANDOUT
Date: 15.01.2021
Course No : CS F342
Course Title : Computer Architecture
Instructors incharge : S Gurunarayanan

Instructor (Lab) : K Ravi Teja
1. Scope and Objective:

This course aims at introducing the concept of computer architecture and organization. It involves design aspects, and
deals with the current trends in computing architecture. System resources such as memory technology and |/O
subsystems needed to achieve proportional increase in performance will also be discussed.

2. Learning outcomes:

Understand various architectural techniques used in implementation of complex logic functions
Apply these techniques in building different computing architectures

Analyze different performance metrics of different computing architectures

Design associated systems resources to achieve proportional increase in performance.
