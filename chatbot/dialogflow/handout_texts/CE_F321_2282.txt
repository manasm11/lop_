COURSE HANDOUT
Date: 16.01.2021

In addition to part I (General Handout for all courses appended to the Time table) this portion gives further
specific details regarding the course.

Course No : CE F321

Course Title : Engineering Hydrology
Instructor-in-C harge : RALLAPALLI SRINIVAS
Instructor(s) : NA

Tutorial/Practical Instructors: Rallapalli Srinivas, Akshay Kumar

1. Course Description:

This course equips students with key concepts and methods in physical and engineering hydrology along with
a background in basic hydrological techniques used by professional engineers Course contains total nine
modules with 40 lecture sessions. In order give an exposure of field application, some virtual field trips will
be organized using videos. The students crediting this course will be able to know different estimation
techniques of hydrological parameters, data analysis in engineering hydrology, frequency analysis of
hydrological parameters, regression analysis, introductory basics of groundwater and surface water hydrology.

2. Scope and Objective of the C ourse:

The course serves as a foundation to the field of engineering hydrology. The course will acquaint students in
fundamentals such as the hydrological cycle, catchment and losses, hydrographs and hyetographs, rainfallrunoff analysis, flood frequency analysis, determination of design rainfall intensity and hyetographs, peak
flow estimation, groundwater process and modelling, reservoir and river flood routing, and introduction to
dams and hydro-economics. The primary objective of the course is to enable students to relate to real life
problems and prepare them to scientifically address them using hydrologic models and decision support tools.
