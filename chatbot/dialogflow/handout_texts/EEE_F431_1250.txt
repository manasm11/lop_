In addition to part I (General Handout for all courses appended to the Time table) this portion gives further
specific details regarding the course.

Course No : EEE F431

Course Title : Mobile Telecommunication Networks
Instructor-in-C harge : Dr. Syed Mohammad Zafaruddin
Instructor(s) : NA

Tutorial/Practical Instructors: NA

1. Course Description: Fundamentals of mobile telecommunications, with an overview of first generation
(analog) systems and more detailed coverage of second generation (digital) technologies; technology basics
including descriptions of wireless network elements, spectrum allocation, frequency re-use, characteristics of
the transmission medium; over the-air (OTA) interface characteristics; capacity, coverage, speech coding,
channel coding and modulation techniques of TDMA and CDMA technologies; network characteristics;
architecture, signaling, element management of IS-41 and GSM networks; call processing; call setup and
release, handoff, roaming, advanced services; mobile data communications; circuit and packet switched data
services, third generation (wideband data) mobile communications system requirements/ architecture.

2. Scope and Objective of the Course: This course is an introduction to the field of mobile
telecommunication systems and networks. The signal propagation, modulation and coding, multiplexing and
link improvement techniques used in mobility management in wireless networks will be emphasized. At
the physical layer, mitigation techniques for deep fading in narrowband as well as wideband mobile systems
will also be discussed. At the MAC layer, the course covers multiple access and various standard protocols
employed in mobile telecommunication networks. The second and third generation wireless systems will be
studied thoroughly to impart the basic concepts involved in cellular operation. Different traffic routing
techniques will also be discussed. Architectural and functional discussion of different wireless networks
like GSM, CDMA, UMTS, WLAN, and LTE will also be introduced. Further concepts like multi-carrier
modulation, Multi-user MIMO will be introduced to apprise the students of the latest trends in mobile
networks. After completion of the course students will be able to understand and analyze mobile
communication systems and networks. Students will also be exposed to simulate different modules of
mobile networks, and analyze the impact of fading on the system performance.
