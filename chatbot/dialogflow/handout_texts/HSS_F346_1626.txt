2. Scope and Objective of the C ourse:

International Relations is the study of an international system that is constituted by territorial states
who enjoy sovereignty over matters of vital interests to them. This course offers the history of the
international system, its functioning, theoretical frameworks and the nature of the changing relations
between the states and non-state actors. This course offers a critical reflection and analytical
understanding of key defining events and the topical issues that not only shaped but also confronted
the existing international order. The course encourages students to engage in debates on the nature of
international order as well as the responses to the challenges of the current international order. The
course is designed to offer both the theoretical frameworks and critical reflections on the contemporary
affairs. Moreover, the students will be able to make a clear perception of the relationship between the
international relations as a discipline and the practice of world politics. Considerable sessions are
devoted to understand India’s role in the contemporary world too.
