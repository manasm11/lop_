COURSE HANDOUT
Date: 15.01.2021

In addition to part I (General Handout for all courses appended to the Time table) this portion gives further
specific details regarding the course.

Course No : PHA F416

Course Title : Chemistry of Synthetic Drugs
Instructor-in-C harge : Dr. Vaibhav A. Dixit
Instructor(s) : Dr. Vaibhav A. Dixit

Tutorial/Practical Instructors: Dr. Vaibhav A. Dixit
1. Course Description:

Study of the physicochemical and biological properties of drugs and drug-likeness concepts and rules.
Introduction to Green Chemistry and Toxicology Principles. Historical and modem methods of drug
synthesis; mechanism of some heterocyclic drug synthesis; study of five and six-membered heterocyclic
compound synthesis. Classification of C-C bond forming reactions and use in drug synthesis. Named
reactions will be discussed in brief when appropriate.

2. Scope and Objective of the C ourse:

This course is designed to introduce important chemical and pharmaceutical concepts, and methodologies
used in the design, synthesis, and development of drugs. The course is divided into four main sections: A )
Physicochemical, biological and drug-like properties of molecules. B) Organic chemistry reactions used for
drug synthesis. C) Classical methods of drug synthesis based on the chemical classification of drugs and D)
Modern drug synthesis methodologies based on different carbon-carbon bond forming reaction types e.g.
coupling reactions. Design principles, reaction mechanisms, role of catalysts, and solvents will be explained
when appropriate. Green chemistry principles and the need for the development of environmentally friendly
processes will be discussed. Representative examples of marketed drugs will be covered throughout the
course. Students will be encouraged to solve problems in each unit and design their own synthetic
methodologies for selected drugs. Case studies will be discussed when appropriate.

Prerequisite includes a basic knowledge of IUPAC nomenclature, organic compound classification,
elementary organic reactions e.g. substitution (SN1 and SN2), elimination (E1 and E2), condensation,
oxidations and reductions. Concepts like acids-bases, pH, pKa, nucleophile/electrophile, enzyme kinetics
(Km, Vmax, Ki). Prerequisite courses are PHA F241, PHA F242.

Objectives of the course: After completion of this course the students are expected to:

1. List chemical, biological, and pharmacological properties of drugs and “drug-like” compounds.

2. Perform basic calculations related to like pH, pKa, log P/D, PK-PD properties, Ligand efficiency and
toxicity metrics. Attempt to identify and prioritize drug-like compounds.

3. Recognize, classify and compare the reactions employed in drug synthesis.

4. List and illustrate basic principles of green chemistry and toxicology.

Students should note the following important points.

1)

Students are strongly advised to prepare their own class notes using relevant information from lectures,
text, reference books, and research/review articles given above. These notes are to be prepared/written in
separate, dedicated notebook for this course and notebooks containing notes from other courses will not
be allowed during closed book exam/quizzes. These handwritten notes and prescribed text would only be
allowed for consultation during exams and will be used for assessments of open book components.
Photocopies of any material (including research/review articles), written or printed will not be permitted.
Stapled sheets, loose sheets of information written or printed, photocopies of slides used for discussion in
class will not be allowed.

Slides, web-resources, educational/informative videos, multimedia resources and/or software/databases
displayed during lectures provide key information for which additional supportive information is expected
to be collected from these and aforementioned sources. The slides and selected material/information will
not be shared and hence students are requested/advised to make their own notes during class hour. Recent
developments in the area/topic will be discussed in class based on their significance to chemistry,
biochemistry, synthesis and pharmacology of the drugs, besides others, and may differ from the
information in text, reference material and hence students are expected to take note of such key discussions
during lectures. Such discussions held in class will be considered as primary source of information in
assessments.

Quiz(zes) may/will be conducted as a part of evaluation component, at random, during contact hours
including lectures, tutorial hours, as convenient, with/without prior intimation and hence it is expected that
the students come prepared to every class on topics covered in earlier lectures. Students are also requested
to refresh their knowledge in basic organic reactions, chemical and biochemical concepts, and in topics
and concepts covered in the prerequisite courses.

Mid-Sem. Grading would be done once at least 30-40 % evaluation components are completed.

For all evaluation components, information given during classroom instruction, aforementioned text books
and reference books in the same order, will be considered as correct. Students are advised to follow the
text, reference material as given in hand-out. All evaluation components are equally important,
irrespective of weightage. Hence, students failing to attend scheduled classes, or absenting themselves in
one or many of the evaluation components, may become ineligible for obtaining a valid grade at the end
of the semester. Attendance in lectures, timely submission of assignments, and quizzes are all equally
important as they are all integral components of learning, irrespective of weightage and may be taken into
consideration, during grading.

Hence, students are strongly advised to keep away from absenting themselves from all aforementioned
contact sessions. Clearing the course would require adequate performance in written quizzes**, tests**,
and examinations**, separately ( i.e. earning low marks in evaluation components, aforementioned**,
would not suffice, to clear the course).

Any other adaptive changes in the handout, will be announced in class, if any.

Reading Assignments: Students are advised to read, collect additional information on the above mentioned
topics as per given schedule.

7. Chamber C onsultation Hour:

Students are advised to attend the majority of the classes (>95 %), read study material, given literature,
textbooks and reference books on all topics within a week of the topic being covered in the lectures. They
are also encouraged to ask clarification on major queries on the subject matter within the lecture hours and
minor (non-urgent) queries can be reserved for consultation hours. Consultation hours will be announced
in the lectures on weekly/fortnightly basis.

8. Notices:

Notices concerning this course will be displayed on Department of Pharmacy Notice Board. Students are
advices to check notice board (and Nalanda account/BITS email) regularly.

9, Make-up Policy:

Generally make-up will be considered only for regular students (90% attendance) under very rare
circumstances based on the genuineness of the case assessed on a case-to-case basis. No makeup will be
granted for quizzes and all would be considered for evaluation.
