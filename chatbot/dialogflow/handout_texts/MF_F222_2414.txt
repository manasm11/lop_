SECOND SEMESTER 2020-2021
Course Handout (Part IT)

In addition to the part I (General Handout for all courses appended to the time table) this portion gives further
specific details regarding the course.

Course No.: MF F222

Course Title: Casting, Forming and Welding
Instructor-in-C harge: Radha Raman Mishra
1. Course Description

Study of quantitative and qualitative analyses of manufacturing processes enables engineers to understand the
design requirements of an industrial component for possible manufacturing. The present course acquaints
students with the manufacturing processes such as Casting (pattern, mould and gating system design, casting
processes, defects and inspection), Forming (mechanics of forming processes; forming operations, friction and
lubrication, forming defects), Welding (principles of solid-phase welding and liquid phase welding, soldering,
brazing and adhesive bonding; newer welding processes, welding and additive manufacturing, weld defects
and inspection), Plastic processing (types of plastics, processing methods, advantages, limitations and
applications) and Powder metallurgy (introduction, need, powder preparation, compaction, sintering,
advantages, limitations and applications).

2. Scope and Objective of the C ourse

This course provides theoretical, analytical and practical exposure to the students about the manufacturing
processes such as casting, forming, welding, and powder metallurgy. Moreover, it enables learners to
understand process design requirements for possible manufacturing of the industrial components.
