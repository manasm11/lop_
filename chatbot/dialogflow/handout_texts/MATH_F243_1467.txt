SECOND SEMESTER 2020-21
COURSE HANDOUT
Date: 18.01.2021

In addition to part-I (General Handout for all courses appended to the time table) this portion gives further
specific details regarding the course.

Course No : MATH F243

Course Title : Graphs and Networks
Instructor-in-C harge : Krishnendra Shekhawat
Instructor(s) ‘

Tutorial/Practical Instructors: K rishnendra Shekhawat

1. Course Description: This course begins with the basics of Graphs, i.e., it starts with the Simple Graphs
and types of Graphs. Then it discusses the Isomorphism in Graphs along with the Euler & Hamiltonian
Graphs. After that it talks about Trees and Spanning Trees, Connectivity, Cut Set and Shortest Path, Matrix
representation of Graphs, and Maximal Flow in a Network. At the end, it discusses Graph Colouring,
Independence number and Chromatic Number.

2. Scope and Objective of the Course: The importance of graph theory can never be exaggerated
considering the wide range of its applications, from social sciences to electrical engineering and computer
science to management. The rigorous foundation of the subject is thus desirable. The objective of the course
is, in addition to logical foundations, theoretical developments and development of the basic skills to tackle
problems in Graph theory. It also aimed at understanding how various problems arising from real life or
sciences as well as recreational puzzles can be converted to graph theoretic problems like shortest paths,
network flows, chromatic numbers, connectivity etc.
