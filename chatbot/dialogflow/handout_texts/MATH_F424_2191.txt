Tutorial/Practical Instructors: Dr. Anirudh Singh Rana

1. Course Description:

A stochastic process is a mathematical model describing the evolution of a system via sequences of random
events. Stochastic processes, as a branch of statistics, finds its applications in many disciplines including core
sciences such as biology, chemistry, economics, ecology, finance, neuroscience, and physics as well as
technology and engineering related fields such as the modelling of spread of infectious diseases, the evolution
of genetic sequences, models for climate change, reliability theory, image processing, signal processing,
information theory, computer science, cryptography and telecommunications.

2. Scope and Objective of the C ourse:

The primary objective of this course is to familiarize students with the fundamental concepts and simulation
techniques of probability theory and stochastic process.
