Course No :
Course Title :
Instructor-in-C harge

Instructor(s) : NA
T utorial/Practical Instructors: NA

 

1. Course Description: Management Science A pproach to Problem Solving, Linear Programming (LP):
Model Formulation and Graphical Solution, Linear Programming: Computer Solution and Sensitivity
Analysis, Linear Programming: Modelling and Applications, Linear Programming: The Simplex Method,
Transportation and Assignment Problem, Integer Programming (IP) and Goal Programming (GP), Waiting
Lines and Queuing Theory Models, Simulation Modeling etc.

2. Scope and Objective of the C ourse:
Management Science aims to solve decision-making problems that confront and confound managers in real

life by developing mathematical models of those problems. The course will be built on basics of mathematical
modelling skills and then will focus on real life Applications and Solutions using software. Students will
develop decision-making skills as outcome of this course. This course has become very significant in todayâ€™s
era of Analytics and today it is also called Prescriptive A nalytics.

Case Analysis: Cases will be assigned time to time. Students must read the case assigned, do proper analysis
and come fully prepared for discussions in class. It is highly desired that students must attend all classes and
contribute in case discussions.

Mini Project: Students will take any real Management Science problem and do projects in groups. At the end
of semester, all groups will give presentation and submit report.

7. Chamber C onsultation Hour: Friday after class.

8. Notices: All notices of this course will be displayed on the Department of Management Notice Board or
Online.

9, Make-up Policy: Make-ups may be allowed only in genuine cases with prior permission of I/C.
10. Team Formation: Students have to give mini-project presentations in a team. Teams will be formed by
Instructor.
