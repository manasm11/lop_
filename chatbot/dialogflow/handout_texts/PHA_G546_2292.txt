SECOND SEMESTER 2019-20
COURSE HANDOUT
Date: 09.01.2021

In addition to part I (General Handout for all courses appended to the Time table) this portion gives further
specific details regarding the course.

Course No : PHA G 546
Course Title : Pharmaceutical Biostatistics
Instructor-in-C harge : Richa Shrivastava

1. Course Description:

This course deals with different types of data, methods for data collection, organization and summarization
of data, probability distributions, descriptive measures (measures of central tendency and measures of
dispersion), sampling and estimation of parameters (point estimates and interval estimates), tests of
hypothesis using parametric (T-TEST and ANOVA) and various non-parametric tests, correlation and linear
regression. Determining the sample size for a study and estimating Bio-equivalence of pharmaceutical
products using statistical methods will also be covered. All the topics covered will be related to the field of
pharmaceutical sciences.

2. Scope and Objective of the C ourse:
The objective of the course is to impart knowledge on various types of data, determining the descriptive

measures and estimates for a given data. To provide a detailed understanding of various types of parametric
and non-parametric tests used in statistical analysis of data. The students should be able to select and apply
an appropriate parametric/non-parametric test for a given data and interpret the results obtained. The
students will also learn how to determine the sample size for a given study and perform statistical analysis
and interpretation of data obtained from bio-equivalence studies.
