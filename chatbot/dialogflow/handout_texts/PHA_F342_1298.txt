specific details regarding the course

Course No. : PHA F342

Course Title : Medicinal Chemistry II
Instructor-in-Charge : R. Mahesh

1. Scope and Objective of the Course:
This course deals with the study of important classes of drugs that are listed below. Various aspects like

structure, properties, therapeutic and pharmaceutical importance and the uses of drug molecules both
of natural and synthetic origin will be covered. Study of physico-chemical properties, mechanism of
action, S.A.R. and metabolism of drugs dealt hereunder will also be emphasized. Special emphasis will
be given on important topics such as Anti hypertensive drugs, Drugs affecting sugar metabolism,
Antimalarial drugs, Anticancer agents, Antiviral agents etc.

* Continuous assessment may include quiz(zes)#, Practicum experience** Laboratory - Day to Day work
and quiz(zes), Viva-Voce, Home assignment, and Lab. component including Lab. Compre., etc.

** Practicum experience, Assignment(s) may be practical / theory oriented, for which a proper
documentation and submission of records and reports in a standard format should be submitted
as per deadline(s) that would be announced. It may also include a viva and or seminar

presentation(s).

S It is strongly advised that all students prepare their own class notes and relevant information
from text, reference material, as in handouts would only be allowed for consultation during
assessments of open book/notes. Photocopies of any material, written or printed will not be
permitted. Stapled sheets , loose sheets of information written or printed, photocopies of slides

used for discussion in class will not be allowed.

*Slides used during class hours provide key information for which additional supportive information
is expected to be collected from sources aforementioned. These slides will not be shared and hence
students are requested/advised to make their own notes during class hour. Recent developments in
the area/topic will be discussed in class based on their significance to healthcare delivery and hence
some information on therapeutic benefits and toxicity effects, besides others, may differ from the
information in text, reference material and hence students are expected to take note of such key
discussions during contact hours. Such discussions held in class will be considered as primary source

of information in assessments. Also note that all classes will be held (online/in person) as
announced by AUGRD/AUGSD, from time to time and students are requested to note the same.

* Practicum experience ( Lab. component), Assignment(s) may be practical / theory oriented, for which a
proper report in a standard format should be submitted as per deadline(s) that would be announced. It
may also include a viva and or seminar presentation(s).

# Quiz(zes) may/will be conducted as a part of evaluation component, at random, during contact

hours including lecture, tutorial hours, as convenient, with/without prior intimation and sometimes
outside class contact hours ( for both theory and practical) and hence it is expected that the
students come prepared to every class on topics covered in earlier contact hours. Regular classes will
be held in designated tutorial hour to maintain continuity. Students are also requested to refresh

their knowledge in basic organic reactions and in topics and concepts covered in the course
Medicinal Chemistry -I.

6. Mid-Sem. Grading would be done once at least 30-40 % evaluation components are completed.

7. For all evaluation components, information given during classroom instruction,

aforementioned text books and reference books in the same order, will be considered as

CE
correct. Students are advised to follow the text, reference material as given in hand-out.
All evaluation components are equally important, irrespective of weightage. Hence
students failing to attend scheduled classes, or absenting themselves in one or many _ of the
evaluation components, may become ineligible for obtaining a valid grade at the end of the
semester. Attendance in lectures, tutorials and practicum experience are all equall

important as they are all integral components of learning, irrespective of weightage and
may be taken into consideration, during grading.

 

 

 

 

 

 

Hence, students are strongly advised to keep away from absenting themselves from all
aforementioned contact sessions. Clearing the course would require adequate performance in
written quizzes**, tests**, examinations**, and in practicum experience components, separately
(i.e. procuring low marks in evaluation components, aforementioned**, other than practicum
experience, would not suffice, to clear the course).

Any other adaptive changes in the handout, will be announced in class, if any.

Reading Assignments: Students are advised to read, collect additional information on the above
mentioned topics as per given schedule.

Chamber consultation hours: Room No: 3170-S; 01596515207; time to be announced in class.

Notices: Notices concerning the course will be displayed on the Pharmacy Department notice
board only.

Make-Ups: Make-Ups are not given as a routine. It is solely dependent upon the
GENUINENESS OF THE CIRCUMSTANCES under which a student fails to appear in a scheduled
evaluation component. In such circumstances, prior permission should be obtained from the
Instructor-in-Charge. In no case the make-up letter be slipped inside the chamber of the
Instructor-In-Charge. The decision of the Instructor- in-Charge will be final.
