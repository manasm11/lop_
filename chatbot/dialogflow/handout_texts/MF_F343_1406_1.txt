Course Description:

Casting processes, pattern and mould design, metal melting and handling, metallurgical aspects of
casting, metal flow and heat transfer, analysis of casting defects. Injection moulding of plastics. Gas
cutting and welding processes including its physics, chemistry and metallurgy, power source
characteristics, different welding techniques, selection of welding processes, destructive and nondestructive testing of weldments, welding standards and codes, analysis of welded joints, brazing and
soldering.

Scope and Objective of the C ourse:

In-depth comprehension about casting and welding processes which are the basic pillar of manufacturing

is mandatory for a mechanical or manufacturing engineer. The casting and welding processes are common,

broad and versatile operation in part manufacturing and their importance are indispensible in modem

product manufacturing. This course aims

e To nurture fresh talents and transform them to competent manufacturing engineers by studying
various casting and welding processes in detail.

e To develop the theoretical and practical knowledge base about the fundamentals of casting and
welding processes and their role in product manufacturing.

e To analyze each and every manufacturing process to improve overall productivity.

e To analyze the process for obtaining desired dimensional as well as geometrical accuracy of the part
as per design requirement and evaluate the product performance.
