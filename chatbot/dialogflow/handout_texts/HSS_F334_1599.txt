further specific details regarding the course.

Course No.: HSS F334

Course Title: SRIMAD BHAGAVAD GITA
Instructor-in-Charge : MANOJ KANNAN
Co-instructor VINAY CHAMOLA

1. Course Description:

This course introduces students the timeless wisdom spoken by Lord Krishna in the Bhagavad
Gita and enables them to appreciate and apply those in daily life. Beginning with the fundamentals
of the need to understand spirituality, the content includes science of soul, various types of yogic
practices, viz., karma-yoga (action in Krishna consciousness), jnana-yoga (philosophical research
for truth), dhyana-yoga (meditative practice), astanga-yoga (eightfold yoga system) and
culminates with bhakti-yoga (devotional service to Krishna). Adopting a topical approach, the
course also touches upon these subject matters: the most confidential knowledge, three modes of
material nature, nature, enjoyer and the consciousness, divine and demoniac qualities, and the
perfection of knowledge.

2. Scope and Objective:
Meant for anyone who wants to make his or her life peaceful, blissful and perfect by aligning
oneself to the principles set forth in Srimad Bhagavad Gita, the prime objectives of this course are
to understand our relationship (sambhandha) with Krishna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead,
the process of reviving that relationship (abhidheya), and the goal of that process (prayojana).

7. Attendance Policy:
While the Academic Regulations do not stipulate a minimum percentage of attendance before a
student is permitted to appear in any test/examination, because the Institute has an internal and
continuous evaluation system, these regulations clearly expect every student to be responsible for
regularity of his/her attendance. Particularly for this course, presence in lectures and attentive
hearing is a pre-requisite for the successful completion. Attendance will be recorded in each and

every contact session. In case a student misses a lecture, he/she would do well to inform the
instructor-in-charge prior to the class to avail the benefit of excused absence.

8. Grading Policy:

Award of grades would be guided by the histogram of marks and course average. If a student
happens to be in the borderline of two grades, the decision on the final grade will be based on
his/her regularity in attending classes, participation in discussions and timely submission of
assignments. W hen in spite of all the facilities such as make-up, feedback from examinations and
interaction with the teacher, a student fails to cooperate with the teacher in the discharge of his/her
part of the contract to such an extent that the teacher is unable to award any grade, regulations
allow the Instructor-in-Charge to give a "Not Cleared" (NC) report.

9, Make up policy:

10.

11.

For a foreseen absence in mid-semester test, comprehensive examination or quiz, the make-up
request should be made personally to the Instructor-in-Charge, well ahead of the component.
Reasons for unanticipated absence that qualify a student to apply for make-up include medical
emergencies or personal exigencies only. In such an event, the student should contact the
Instructor-in-Charge at the earliest. No make-ups are generally possible for assignments,
particularly the in-class ones, unless the genuineness of the case is compelling enough, or a leave
of excused absence has been granted by the Instructor-in-Charge.

Chamber C onsultation:
Appointment can be taken by sending an email.
