further specific details regarding the course.

Course No : CHE Gd28

Course Title : Introduction to Nano Science and Technology
Instructor-in-C harge : Krishna Etika

Instructor(s) : Banasri Roy

Practical/Project Instructors: Krishna Etika and Banasri Roy
1. Course Description:

Nanotechnology promises to be the technology of the future benefitting humanity in a number of ways. This
course is aimed at preparing students for further industrial or academic work in the field of nanotechnology.
The objective of this course is to introduce the basics concepts of nanomaterials science and technology with
special emphasis on synthesis, characterization, and applications of nanomaterials in various fields such as
electronics, medical, MEMS, photonics, catalysis, energy, and heat transfer. This course will also deal with
the quantum mechanical aspects of nanomaterials. Furthermore, future directions in nanoscience and
technology and large scale manufacture and technological issues will also be discussed.

2. Scope and Objective of the C ourse:

The course content has been structured to provide a well-rounded overview of the principles of nanoscience
and nanotechnology. The course will include common synthesis methods for the nanoparticles, their
characterization and will also discuss the unique properties of nanomaterials, which makes them an
attractive material for many applications. Laboratory demonstrations will include nanoparticles synthesis
and characterization experiments. Emphasis is laid on demonstrating the motivation and use of
nanomaterials in a variety of applications. This course is aptly suited for any student looking to get hands-on
training in the widely prevalent field of nanoscience and nanotechnology.
