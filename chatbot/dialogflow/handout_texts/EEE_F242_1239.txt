Instructor(s) : Dr. B.K. Mukherjee, Dr. H.O. Bansal

Tutorial/Practical Instructors: Dr. B.K. Mukherjee, Dr. H.O. Bansal, Dr. K.K. Gupta, Dr. P. Mishra,
Dr. A.R. Gautam, Mr. A. Jahagirdar

1. Course Description: Modeling and classification of dynamical systems, Properties and advantages of
feedback systems, time-domain analysis, frequency-domain analysis, stability and performance analysis, State
space analysis, controller design.

2. Scope and Objective of the Course: Feedback or automatic control is an essential feature of numerous
industrial processes, scientific instruments and even commercial, social and management situations. A
thorough understanding of the elementary principles of this all-embracing technology is of great relevance for
all engineers and scientists in general and Electrical & Electronics engineers in particular. This course tries to
bring out the basic principles of Feedback Control Systems.
