SECOND SEMESTER 2020-21
COURSE HANDOUT
Date: 15.01.2021

In addition to part I (General Handout for all courses appended to the Time table) this portion gives further
specific details regarding the course.

Course No : MATH F353
Course Title : Statistical Inference and A pplications
Instructor-in-C harge : Rakhee

1. Course Description: R eview of elements of probability and statistical methods, Classical Decision theory including
parametric and non-parametric methods for testing of hypotheses, Analysis of Variance: One way and two way
classifications, Design of experiments: Analysis of Completely randomized design, Randomized block design and Latin
Square design with one or more missing values, Statistical Quality control for variables and measurements.

2. Scope and Objective of the C ourse:
The course deals with some of the statistical techniques of decision-making. Test of hypotheses, both parametric

and nonparametric methods will be discussed. Comparison of two treatments will be discussed. Comparison of
several treatments using analysis of variance will be dealt with. Control charts for measurements and attributes
will also be discussed.
