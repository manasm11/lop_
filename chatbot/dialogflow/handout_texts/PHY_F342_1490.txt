Second Semester 2020-2021
Date: 10 Jan 2021
Course No.: PHY F342
Course Title: Atomic and Molecular Physics
Instructor-in-Charge: Amol Holkundkar
Scope and Objective:

The aim of this course is to present a comprehensive account of the physics of atoms and molecules and
the related spectroscopy. The atomic physics part will include structure of single, two and many-electron
atoms, the interaction of atoms with electromagnetic radiation and elements of atomic spectra. The
molecular physics part will comprise electronic structure of diatomic and polyatomic molecules within
the Born-Oppenheimer approximation and elements of electronic, vibrational and rotational spectra of
molecules. The course will be the students’ first encounter with serious applications of quantum theory.

Evaluation Scheme:

There will be 4 tutorial tests (18 marks) and 1 take home assignment (18 marks). The take-home
assignment will be given before the last tutorial test. Two tutorial tests will be before mid-term
and 2 will be after. All the tutorial tests will be announced a week before.
