Course Title : ENGINEERING OPTIMIZATION
Instructor-in-charge : RAJESH P MISHRA

Instructor : Aakash C Rai

Tutorial Instructors : Rajesh P Mishra, Aakash C Rai, Sachin U Belgamwar and Murali Palla

1. Scope and Objective of the C ourse:

Engineers, scientists, analysts and managers are often faced with the challenge of making
trade-offs between different factors in order to achieve desirable outcomes. Optimization is the
process of choosing these trade-offs in the best way. Optimization problems, having reached a
degree of maturity over the past several years, are encountered in physical sciences, engineering,
economics, industry, planning, and many other areas of human activity. Objective of the course is
to familiarize the students with standard methods of solving optimization problems.

This course deals with details of various aspects associated with optimization. These include
description of optimization techniques, namely, linear programming and non-linear programming,
and their applications to various engineering and science disciplines including economics and
finance. Multi-objective optimization which handles optimization aspects of more than one
objective is also discussed.
