Note:

e Highest level of intellectual integrity is expected of students while they work on term papers /
projects in terms of giving proper acknowledgement and avoiding plagiarism. Students are also
expected to submit their assignments on time failing which these may not be evaluated.

e This course is highly dynamic in its nature and content. As a result, one book may not suffice
for achieving the learning objectives properly. However, the text book prescribed in this handout
Should provide the fundamental for most of the modules to be discussed in this course. The
reference books, as specifically mentioned, should be consulted simultaneously along with the
text book. A lot of additional material (hard copy or soft copy) or reference to those materials
will be provided in the class.

e It shall be the responsibility of the individual student to be regular in maintaining the self-study
schedule as given in the course handout, attend lectures and participate in the class-room
activities / case studies as well as execute projects as announced in the class and / or in Nalanda.

e Mid Semester Test and Comprehensive Examination are according to the Evaluation Scheme
given in the respective Course Handout, as decided by the Instruction Division.

e If the student is unable to appear for the Regular Test/Examination due to genuine exigencies,
the student must refer to the procedure for applying for Make-up Test / Examination.
