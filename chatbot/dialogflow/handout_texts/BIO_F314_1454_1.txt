COURSE HANDOUT (PART II

In addition to part-l (General Handout for all courses) printed on page 1 of the timetable book, this portion
gives further specific details regarding the course.

Course Number : BIO F314

Course Title : Conservation Biology

Instructor-in-charge : SANDHYA MARATHE (sandhya.marathe@pilani.bits-pilani.ac.in)
Instructor(s) :NA

Tutorial/Practical Instructors : SANDHYA MARATHE (sandhya.marathe@pilani.bits-pilani.ac.in)

1. Course description:

Fundamentals of conservation biology; biological diversity- its measurement, value and threatened status;
concepts related to conservation at the population and species levels; protection, management and
restoration of ecosystems; and sustainable development and community-based conservation;
conservation legislation. Course practicum will be effected through classroom and field activities.

2. Scope and Objectives of the course:

With the biodiversity crisis looming large, conservation biology is fast emerging as a field that requires
urgent progress. This course will educate and train students on the foundations and advances in
conservation science. The students will develop a scientific approach to study the current state of the
natural world, the threats posed due to human activities and the effort involved in conserving it.

The course will deal with the fundamental, intellectual, conceptual, and practical problems that
conservation biologists need to address and solve. Topics that will be taught include some key concepts
related to the conservation at various trophic levels, systematic conservation planning, sustainability,
community-based conservation. The course will also offer a glimpse of the state-of-the-art research and
field work by leading Institutes and NGOs in the Indian context. The course includes a compulsory practical
component in the form of on and off-the-field assignment(s) that will attempt, in a small way, to bridge
the gap between the theory covered and real world conservation efforts.

9. Community-based | L9.1 —9.2: Cultural traditions, local Understanding history of
conservation participation, ecological and community based
economic view conservation

 

* Special readings: As the subject is vast, students are expected to read topics from reference books and
research/review articles as and when recommended by the Instructors.

6. Practical hours: On-field or in-silico projects &/or field trips/documentary screening (whenever feasible)
will be accounted for as practical hours of the course.

7. Evaluation Scheme

Evaluation component Duration | Weight | Date and time [Remarks |
Mid-semester Test (theory+ lab) <TEST_1>

|Quizzes &assignment |= | 10% | Surprise
/Practicalcomponent |= | 25% | Continuous ___| Open book
<TEST_C>

Students to note that participation with uniform & enthusiastic sincere effort in all activities of the course
mentioned in the handout will be absolutely essential for registering a good performance in the course.

 

8. Grading Policy:

Award of grades would be based on the student’s participation, regularity and performance, and
instructor's overall assessment of the individual’s sincerity and ability. If the student absents
himself/herself in any one of the components (listed in evaluation scheme) entirely, his/her performance
may be reported as NC (Not Cleared). Student gaining less than 10% marks in theory component may be
awarded NC grade.

9. Office Consultation Hour: To be announced in class.
10. Make-up Policy:

Make-ups for any evaluative component will be granted only in case of severe medical problem,
hospitalization. However, instructor should be informed beforehand or at the earliest after missing the
evaluation component. The decision to grant make-up or not is taken by the instructor-in-charge and shall
be final.

11. Course notices:

All course announcements shall be displayed only in the Dept. of Biological Sciences notice board or
announced during the lecture.
