SECOND SEMESTER 2020-21
COURSE HANDOUT

 

Date: 18.01.2021

In addition to part I (General Handout for all courses appended to the Time table) this portion gives further
specific details regarding the course.

Course No : MATH F342

Course Title : DIFFERENTIAL GEOMETRY
Instructor-in-C harge : PRADIPKUMAR H. KESKAR
Instructor(s) : PRADIPKUMAR H. KESKAR

Tutorial/Practical Instructors: PRADIPKUMAR H. KESKAR

1. Course Description:

The course studies geometric objects like curves and surfaces in the 3- dimensional space. Topics include plane and space
curves, Serret-Frenet frame and curvature and torsion of curves, global properties of curves, first and second fundamental
forms of surfaces, normal, principal and Gaussian curvatures of surfaces, Gauss’ Theorema Egregium and geodesics on
surfaces.

2. Scope and Objective of the C ourse:

The objective of this course is to provide a systematic exposition of the essential concepts of modern differential
geometry, and an understanding and appreciation for the intrinsic beauty of these concepts, as well as their deep
relationships to computer and physical Sciences. The under current is to generalize and reinforce the classical subject
in a moder way.
