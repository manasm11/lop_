COURSE HANDOUT

specific details regarding the course.

Course No : GS F242
Course Title : Cultural Studies
Instructor-in-C harge : Dr. Muhammed Afzal P

1. Course Description:

This course provides an introduction to Cultural Studies as an interdisciplinary academic field and intellectual
practice. Cultural Studies examines cultural practices (which includes diverse kinds of “signifying”’/meaningmaking practices) and their relation to power. Blurring the distinction between “high culture” and “low
culture”, Cultural Studies takes up for analysis everyday practices and contemporary popular cultural forms
such as popular cinema, TV shows, advertisements, digital cultures, etc. Beginning with an overview of the
field as it emerged in Britain in the 1960s, the course introduces key concepts in critical and cultural theory
such as “culture”, “popular”, “contemporary”, “representation”, “discourse”, “power”, “ideology”,
“articulation”, “hegemony”, “identity’’, “identity-politics’’, “minority”, etc. The second part of the course will
take up for analysis cultural texts and practices mainly from the Indian context. Issues such as nationalism,
gender, sexuality, caste, Adivasi identity, religious identity, disability, etc., will be discussed in the second
part of the course.

2. Scope and Objective of the C ourse:

The course will introduce the major theoretical approaches and concepts in the field of Cultural Studies.
Drawing on texts from both the global and the local contexts, the course aims to equip students to analyze
cultural texts and practices from across the world by utilizing the theoretical approaches taught in the course.
The students will be able to produce their own interdisciplinary research projects by the end of the course.
