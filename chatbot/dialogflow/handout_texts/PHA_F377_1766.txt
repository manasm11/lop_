9. Grading Procedure:

In addition to what is mentioned in Part I of the handout, the grading will be done mainly on the basis of the
progress made towards attainment of the project objectives and will recognize that each Instructor has given

recommend a grade for his student for the consideration of the Instructor-in-charge. In a specialized

course of this nature the respective Instructor's assessment of the student vis-a-vis the objective of the
project would be the central criteria for arriving at final grade.
