Course Handout Part-I]
15 January 2021

Course Number : PHY F343
Course Title : NUCLEAR AND PARTICLE PHYSICS
Instructor-in-charge: BISWANATH LAYEK

Course Description:

The course is designed to give a pedagogical overview and some working knowledge of theoretical
(mainly) and experimental aspects of Nuclear & Particle Physics. Knowledge of quantum
mechanics and basics of special relativity are essential to understand the topics covered in this
course. This course will prepare/motivate students to take advanced courses either in Nuclear and/or
Particle Physics, later on, in their career in preparation for pursuing active research in these areas.

Objective and Scope of the C ourse:

e Understanding the basic concepts behind the various Nuclear & Particle Physics
phenomenon, structure and constituent of the nuclei.

e This course will enable the students to understand the general properties of nuclei, physics
behind nuclear processes e.g., alpha decay, beta decay, nuclear scattering, nuclear fission,
fusion etc.

e It will finally prepare the students to take advanced course in the area of Nuclear
Physics/Particle Physics and help them in making career in teaching/research in the above
fields.
