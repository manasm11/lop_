In addition to part-| (General handout for all courses appended to the timetable) this portion gives further specific
details regarding the course:

Course Number : IS F462 
Course Title : Network Programming
Instructor In-Charge : HARI BABU K
Course Website : httos://canvas.instructure.com/courses/2518080

1. Scope and Objective of the Course
This course is intended for software engineers involved in developing, maintaining and supporting distributed and
network applications in the UNIX environment. The course teaches about system programming necessary for
server and client programming. It teaches programming aspects of low-level protocol TCP, UDP, raw sockets, data
link level access, multicast, broadcast etc. It covers the recent developments in web programming and web server
technologies. It will also teach about distributed programming aspects like RPC, and web services. Course structure
involves interesting assignments and labs to strengthen the concepts.
