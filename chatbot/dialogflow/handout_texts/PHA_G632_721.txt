COURSE HANDOUT
Date: 10/03/2021

In addition to part I (General Handout for all courses appended to the Time table) this portion gives further
specific details regarding the course.

Course No : PHA G632

Course Title : Dosage Form Design

Instructor-in-C harge : Dr Anil Jindal

Instructor(s) 
Practical Instructors: Mr. Rupesh, Mr. Atharva Rajendra Bhide, Mr. Rajesh Pradhan

1. Course Description: A study of physical and chemical, pharmacological and biopharmaceutic factors
involved in the design and stability of dosage forms; transport of drugs across biological membranes;
absorption, distribution and elimination of drugs; formulation additives, closures and containers and
sustained release dosage forms; microencapsulation; radio pharmaceuticals.

2. Scope and Objective of the Course: It is a course intended to give the students an idea of various
aspects of designing of different dosage forms particularly for new drugs, and factors to be considered for
such designs, studies of effects of different additives used for designing different dosage forms. This
course also deals with different controlled release delivery systems, aerosols, and various newer and
novel modern drug delivery systems, packaging materials.

a) Itis strongly advised that all students prepare their own class notes and relevant information from
text, reference material, as in handouts would only be allowed for consultation during assessments
of open book/notes. Photocopies of any material, written or printed will not be permitted. Stapled
sheets , loose sheets of information written or printed, photocopies of slides used for discussion in
class will not be allowed.

b) Slides used during class hours provide key information for which additional supportive information
is expected to be collected from sources aforementioned. These slides will not be shared and hence
students are requested/advised to make their own notes during class hour.

c) For all evaluation components, information given during classroom instruction, aforementioned text
books and reference books in the same order, will be considered as correct. Students are advised to
follow the text, reference material as given in hand-out.

d) All evaluation components are equally important, irrespective of weightage. Hence, students
failing to attend scheduled classes, or absenting themselves in one or many of the evaluation
components, may become ineligible for obtaining a valid grade at the end of the semester.
Attendance in lectures, tutorials and practicum experience are all equally important as they are all
integral components of learning, irrespective of weightage and may be taken into consideration,
during grading.

7. Chamber C onsultation Hour: To be announced in class

8. Notices: Notice, if any, conceming the course will be displayed on the notice Board
of Pharmacy Department Notice Board.

9, Make-up Policy: Make-Ups are not given as a routine. It is solely dependent upon the GENUINENESS
OF THE CIRCUMSTANCES under which a student fails to appear in a scheduled evaluation component. In
such circumstances, prior permission should be obtained from the Instructor-in-Charge. In no case the
make-up letter be slipped inside the chamber of the Instructor-In-Charge. The decision of the Instructor- inCharge will be final.
