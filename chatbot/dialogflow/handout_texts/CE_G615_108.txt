SECOND SEMESTER 2020-21
COURSE HANDOUT

 

Date: 10.03.2021

In addition to part I (General Handout for all courses appended to the Time table) this portion gives further
specific details regarding the course.

Course No : CE G615
Course Title : Earthquake Engineering
Instructor-in-C harge : Ravi Kant Mittal

1. Course Description:

Earthquake Engineering course is mainly aimed to provide procedures and design provisions to be
considered for earthquake resistant design of different structural components. The course deals with various
aspects of seismic design, detailing and construction of buildings, bridge, tanks, chimneys, retaining
structures. Earthquake codes and their provisions are to be studied in-depth.

2. Scope and Objective of the Course: Earthquakes are one of the most destructive forces that nature
unleashes on earth. Since earthquakes are so far unpreventable and unpredictable, the only course open to us
is to design and construct the structure in such a manner that the loss of property and life is minimized.
Objective of the course is to know the various aspects in the analysis, design and detailing in order to
produce safe and economical EQ resistant structures.
