SECOND SEMESTER 2020-2021
COURSE HANDOUT (Part IT)
Date: 18 January, 2021

In addition to Part I (General Handout for all courses appended to the time table) portion:

Course Number : MATH F432

Course Title : Applied Statistical Methods
Instructor-In charge : SUMANTA PASARI
Instructor : Sumanta Pasari

1. Course Description:

Applied Statistics is an exciting sub-area of Statistics. It has application in almost all science disciplines
which deal with data and uncertainty. This course builds up fundamental concepts of various key statistical methods necessary to analyze/interpret a variety of practical business/engineering problems. This
course emphasizes the role of statistics in one’s own field of study by making sense of data, developing
self-ability to apply appropriate statistical methods, performing experimental designs and above all, realizing the limitations/inherent assumptions in a statistical test to avoid over interpretation or misinterpretation. The thrust areas covered in this course include probability distributions, statistical inference,
analysis of variance (ANOVA), regression and correlation, discriminant analysis, factor and cluster
analysis, time series analysis and forecasting, nonparametric methods and statistical quality control. The
theoretical learning will be complemented with various case studies and hands-on training in excel.

2. Scope and objective of the course:
This 4 level course is designed with a two-fold purpose. First, it will provide an exposure to various
theoretical univariate/multivariate methods and their practical applications. Second, this course will
improve methodological/analytical maturity to attempt a variety of problems using MS-excel and R.
