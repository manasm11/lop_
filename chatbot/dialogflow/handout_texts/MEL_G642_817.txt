In addition to Part-I (General Handout for all courses appended to the time table) this portion gives further specific

details regarding the course.
Course No. : MEL G642
Course Title : VLSI Architectures
Instructor in charge : S Gurunarayanan
                Chandra Shekhar
Lab Instructors: : Abheek Gupta, Kanika
la. Scope and Objective of the Course:

1b.

To familiarize the student with various architectural techniques used in implementing complex logic functions as
VLSI chips to achieve various design objective such as high performance, low cost, high throughput, low-power
or a combination thereof. Besides the techniques used for creating efficient dedicated hardware architectures for
complex digital functions, the course also covers the architectural techniques and design methods used for
designing programmable processors .

It covers the philosophy behind CISC instruction set and its implementation as a microprocessor chip through the
creation of optimal datapath and a microprogrammed/ hardwired control unit using the flow -chart method.

Next the concept of Reduced Instruction Set Computer (RISC) architecture which implements a streamlined
instruction set on a pipelined execution unit to achieve single cycle execution is covered through an example.
Concepts of superscalar architectures are also covered briefly.

Design of Application Specific Instruction Set Processors (ASIP) is covered next to illustrate how high
performance, low-power and functional flexibility can be simultaneously addressed through them.

Learning Outcomes of the course:
After completion of the course a student would be able to:

> Gain both an overview of scope and an in-depth understanding of the issues and principles involved in the
architecting of fixed-function as well as programmable V LSI circuits.

> Architect and design functional blocks — such as arithmetic functions using combinational / sequential

architecting techniques and control circuits that find applications in general purpose as well as application
Specific processors with context-specific optimum architectures in terms of speed, gate count and power

consumption

Optimally architect the implementation of sequential computational algorithms

Optimally architect the implementation of a CISC instruction set architecture

Optimally architect the implementation of a RISC instruction set architecture

Optimally architect the implementation of an Application Specific Signal Processor
