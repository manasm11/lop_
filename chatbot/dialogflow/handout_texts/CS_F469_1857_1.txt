SECOND SEMESTER 2019-20
COURSE HANDOUT
Date: 16.01.2021

In addition to part I (General Handout for all courses appended to the Time table) this portion gives further
specific details regarding the course.

Course No: CS F469
Course Title: Information Retrieval
Instructor-in-C harge: Vinti A garwal(vinti.agarwal@ pilani.bits-pilani.ac.in)

1. Course Description:

This course studies the theory, design, and implementation of text-based information systems. The
Information Retrieval core components of the course include statistical characteristics of text, representation
of information needs and documents, several important retrieval models (Boolean, vector space, probabilistic,
inference net, language modeling, link analysis), clustering algorithms, collaborative filtering, automatic text
categorization, and experimental evaluation. The software architecture components include design and
implementation of high-capacity text and multimedia retrieval and filtering systems.

2. Scope and Objective of the C ourse:

The course is designed to provide students with a broad understanding in the design and use of information
retrieval techniques. The course also aims at providing a holistic view of information retrieval, which includes
several retrieval concepts and techniques such as representation and indexing of data, text mining, websearch:
basics and advances, multimedia retrieval, etc.
