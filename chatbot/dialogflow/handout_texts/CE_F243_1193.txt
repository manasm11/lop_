Tutorial Instructors : Nishant Roy, Anuj Adhikary

Practical Instructors : Nishant Roy, Kamalesh Kumar, Ankit Singh Mehra, Raghavendra K

Raya, Anuj Adhikary, Danish Fayaz

1. Course Description: Soil Formation and Composition, Index Properties, Soil Classification, Soil Structure,
Compaction, Effective Stress, Permeability, Seepage, Stress due to Applied Load, Consolidation, Shear
Strength, Settlement A nalysis, Soil Exploration, Important Case Histories, Software for Geotechnical Analysis

2. Scope and Objective of the Course: Soil Mechanics deals with the study of soil as foundation/construction
material, its behavior and engineering properties under stresses. The present course is intended to cover the most
essential aspects of soil as an engineering material. The fundamental concepts in soil mechanics will be presented
and their application to the analysis and design of various geotechnical structures will be highlighted.

On successful completion of the course, the student will be able to:

e Develop a fundamental understanding of the behavior of the soil

e Understand the procedure for the characterization of soil

e Appreciate the importance of effective stress principle and its application for the stability assessment of
Geotechnical Structures

e Appreciate the role of compaction in earthwork for highways, railways, airports and other retaining

structures

Assess the rate of flow of water through soil and its implication on the stability of the infrastructure

Assess the magnitude and the rate of consolidation settlement

Compute the shear strength of soil

Develop the skill-sets required to take up further study in Geotechnical Engineering
