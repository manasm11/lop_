SECOND SEMESTER 2020-21
COURSE HANDOUT
Date: 16.01.2021

In addition to part I (General Handout for all courses appended to the Time table) this portion gives further
specific details regarding the course.

Course No : ME F485
Course Title : Numerical Fluid Flow and Heat Transfer
Instructor-in-C harge : Dr. Shyam Sunder Yadav

Instructor(s) : ---
Tutorial/Practical Instructors: ===

1. Course Description: This course is an introduction to the various computational techniques for simulating
fluid flow and heat transfer. We focus on the Finite difference discretization technique on structured C artesian
grid, Finite volume discretization technique on unstructured grids, Numerical solution of steady and transient
convection-diffusion equation, Solution techniques for compressible and incompressible Navier-Stokes
equations, Various methods for solving system of linear equations, Numerical techniques for simulating
turbulent flows.

2. Scope and Objective of the C ourse: This course is intended to develop the numerical skills for solving
the equations governing fluid flow, heat & mass transfer and related transport phenomena. The students first
learn how to derive the governing equation using fundamental laws of mass, momentum and energy
conservation. Once the equations are derived, the student will learn how to simplify and classify the
equations mathematically and how to interpret their physical and mathematical behavior. Subsequently the
course focuses on the different discretization techniques for the governing equations like the finite difference
and finite volume method. Finally, the students will learn different CFD techniques for compressible and
incompressible flows and turbulent flows.

As part of this course, the students have to complete a CFD project using an open source flow solver. They
can write their own code as well in any of the programming languages. Following solvers can be used:
OpenFOAM, SU2, Gerris Flow Solver, IBAMR, preCICE library, IB2D etc. Any other open source code or
Ansys Academic version can also be used for the project.
