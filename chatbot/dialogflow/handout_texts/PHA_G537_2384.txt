Course No. : PHA G537
Course Title. : Parenteral Product Development
Instructor-in-charge : Dr. Anupama Mittal

1. Course Description:

Introduction to parenteral product & their types, products characteristics; Vehicles requirement for
Parenteral Products manufacturing; Formulation & process consideration for development of parenteral
products; Introduction & understanding of various aspects of unit operation in parenteral product
manufacturing; Critical Quality attributes of Parenteral Product; Various Sterilization techniques for
parenteral products; Understanding of key requirements for aseptic processing; Understanding of
Lyophilization techniques of stable product development; Regulatory consideration for safety assessment
of Parenteral Products; Packaging requirement for Parenteral Drug Products; Regulatory perspective for
Complex Injectable products development and filing.

2. Scope and Objective of the course:

This course will provide overview on parenteral product development & designed for students to understand
critical aspect of parenteral product development and manufacturing. This course covers basic information,
understanding and application of key operations followed during parenteral product manufacturing like
lyophilization, aseptic processing, & filtration along with Quality Assurance, control & packaging
requirement. This course also covers regulatory consideration for parenteral product assessment with
respect to safety for intended application.

3. Learning outcome:

e Complete understanding of formulation, process, manufacturing and packaging aspect of
parenteral drug product

e Complete understanding, importance & application of lyophilization process

e Knowledge of critical quality attributes in parenteral product development.

e Knowledge of regulatory expectation for safety assessment of parenteral products
