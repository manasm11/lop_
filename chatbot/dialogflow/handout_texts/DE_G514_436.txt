SECOND SEMESTER 2020-2021
COURSE HANDOUT

 

Date: 11.03.2021

In addition to part I (General Handout for all courses appended to the Time table) this portion gives further
specific details regarding the course.

Course No : DE G514

Course Title : Fracture Mechanics
Instructor-in-C harge : Dr. Sharad Shrivastava
Instructor(s) : Dr. Sharad Shrivastava

Tutorial/Practical Instructors:

1. Course Description: Types of failure, Types of fracture, Modes of fracture, Fracture criteria, Energy release rate,
Stress intensity factor (SIF), Linear elastic fracture mechanics, environmentally assisted cracking (EAC), Weibill
fracture statistics, Plane stress and plane strain, Elastic plastic analysis through J-integral, Crack tip opening
displacement, R-curve, Test methods, Fatigue failure, Mixed mode crack initiation and growth, Crack detection
through NDT.

2. Scope and Objective of the Course:The conventional design is based on yield point. However, it has been
found that often a structural component fails even when the worst loaded point is well within the yield stress. Thus
the design, based entirely on avoiding yielding is not adequate for certain cases. Fracture mechanics is based on
implicit assumption that there exists a crack in the structural component. The crack may be inside the material or at
the subsurface.
