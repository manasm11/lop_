Course Title : INTRODUCTION TO BIOINFORMATICS
InstructorIn charge : SHIBASISH CHOWDHURY

Instructor : Ashish Katyal

1. CROUSE DESCRIPTION:

Introduction to genomic & Proteomics, Biological databases and data mining, sequence similarity
search and sequence alignment, Protein structure predication and structure analysis, use of software
package in Bioinformatics.

2. SCOPES AND OBJECTIVE:
This course designed to impart the beginner wit the fundamentals, which would enable

understanding of the intricacies and vast scope of Bioinformatics. A sampling of the different areas
required for understanding of this upcoming field will be provided along with in slilico exercises to
familiarize individuals with different programme packages.
