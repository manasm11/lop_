SECOND SEMESTER 2020-2021
Course Handout Part II
Date: 17.01.2021
In addition to part-I (General Handout for all courses appended to the time table) this portion gives further details
regarding the course.

Course No: CHEM F243

Course Title: Organic Chemistry-Il
Instructor-in-charge: ANIL KUMAR
Instructor: Anil Kumar

1. Scope and objective of the course: To familiarize the students with stereochemical concepts and their
applications in organic synthesis; important functional group transformations; pericyclic reactions. Emphasis
will be placed not only on the mechanistic and stereoelectronic features but also in preparation of optically active
compounds.

Course learning outcome: After successful completion of the course, students will be able to understand:

e Principal of resolution of a racemic mixture

e Preparation & usefulness of optical active compounds

e Stereochemical aspects of the substitution and elimination reactions
e Thermal and photochemical reactions

e Mechanisms of pericyclic reactions

e Pericyclic reactions & various stereochemical notations
