SECOND SEMESTER 2020-21
COURSE HANDOUT
Date: 15.01.2021

In addition to part I (General Handout for all courses appended to the Time table) this portion gives further specific
details regarding the course.

Course No : CHEM F 431

Course Title : Sustainable C hemistry using Renewables
Instructor-in-Charge : Bibhas R. Sarkar

Instructor(s) Sos

Tutorial/Practical Instructors: -
1. Course Description: The course will provide an overview of the chemistry involved with the utilization of
renewable resources as alternative feedstock for the chemicals and fuels industry, to the currently used ones. Major
emphasis is focused on the chemistry of the renewable bio-based alternative resources and understanding of their
potential as feedstock of future, within the mainstream process structure, to visualize viable switch-over as
necessary. The course will encompass around the bio-refinery concept and will describe the chemistry in all the
essential branches of renewable resources (biomass, oils/ fats, H2, CO2 etc.) and will proliferate the practicality

aspect of applied chemistry using catalysis approach for sustainable technology development.

2. Scope and Objective of the C ourse:
The course will be broadly divided into broad topics as in the course plan. Learning objectives for each of these
broad topics as discussed in the course plan has been described in terms of the projected outcomes â€” what the
learner should be able to do by studying these.
