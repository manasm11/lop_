COURSE HANDOUT
Date: 18.01.2021

In addition to part | (General Handout for all courses appended to the Time table) this portion gives further
Specific details regarding the course.

Course No : MBA G564
Course Title : Decision Making
Instructor-in-C harge : Anil Bhat
Instructor(s) : Shaili Singh

Tutorial/Practical Instructors:

1. Course Description: Decision Analysis, Decisions under certainty and under uncertainty,
Behavioral Decision Making, Framing of Decisions and Psychology of Choice, Common errors,
Paradoxes, Anomalies and Traps, Game theory- simple, two - player and bi- matrix games,
Concepts of dominance, equilibrium and iterated dominance, Negotiation Analysis, J oint and
Collaborative Decisions

2. Scope and Objective of the Course:

The purpose of this course is to present a broad and an integrative approach from the perspectives of decision
analysis, behavioral decision making, game theory and negotiation analysis to managerial decision making.
It will explore
I) How analytically inclined managers should or could make wise decisions (Decision Analysis
perspective)? —A prescriptive approach

li) How ordinary individuals do make decisions (Behavioral Decision Making perspective)? -A
descriptive approach

lil) How groups should make separate interactive decisions (Game Theory perspective)? -A
normative approach and finally

iv) How groups should and could make joint collaborative decisions (Negotiation Analysis
perspective).

The course will use cases, journal articles and exercises to demonstrate the application and critical
appreciation of the concepts and techniques discussed.

10.Note

e Each student has to take up a project by selecting any decision problem of interest that is within the
Scope of the course and collect primary data wherever possible. The progress in the project will be
continuously monitored and evaluated. A written report of the same will have to be finally submitted
to the instructor and also presented before the class.

e Highest level of intellectual integrity is expected of students while they work on term papers/projects
in terms of giving proper acknowledgement and avoiding plagiarism failing which they will be heavily
penalized. Students are also expected to submit their assignments on time failing which these may
not be evaluated.
