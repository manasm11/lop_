SECOND SEMESTER 2020-21
COURSE HANDOUT
Date: 3.04.2021

In addition to part I (General Handout for all courses appended to the Time table) this portion gives further
specific details regarding the course.

Course No : PHA G539
Course Title : Principles of Drug Discovery
Instructor-in-C harge : Richa Shrivastava

1. Course Description: Concepts of cellular mechanisms and processes involving cell surface receptors,
membrane-bound enzymes, protein kinases, proteases, integrins, transporters and channels that facilitate
drug discovery, with special emphasis on non-communicable diseases such as neurological, neuropsychiatric
diseases and disorders, metabolic disorders, cancer. siRNA, anti-sense oligonucleotides, transgenic animals
in drug discovery, long non-coding RNA, emerging trends in receptor - drug trafficking

2. Scope and Objective of the Course: Upon completion of the course, the student will have an in-depth
understanding of various targets of drug discovery like receptors, enzymes, kinases transporters etc. They
will also learn the use of siRNA, oligonucleotides, miRNAs, plasmids, sequencing techniques and
transgenic animals in the process of drug development.

Assignment topics will be announced during the class. Regularity in attendance will be one of the criteria in
deciding the borderline cases at the time of final grading as well as make-up's.

8. Chamber C onsultation Hour: As discussed in the class [Email: richa.shrivastava@ pilani.bitspilani.ac.in]

9, Notices: Notices pertaining to this course will be posted on Nalanda or send via emails.

10. Make-up Policy: Make-Ups are not given as a routine. It is solely dependent upon the genuineness of
the circumstances under which a student fails to appear in a scheduled evaluation component. In such
circumstances, prior permission should be obtained from the Instructor-in-Charge. The decision of the
Instructor-in-Charge in the above matter will be final.
