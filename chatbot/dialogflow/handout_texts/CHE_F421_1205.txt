SECOND SEMESTER 2020-21

COURSE HANDOUT
Date: 16.01.2021

In addition to part I (General Handout for all courses appended to the Time table) this portion gives further
specific details regarding the course.

Course No : CHE F421
Course Title : BIOCHEMICAL ENGINEERING
Instructor-in-C harge : AMIT JAIN

1. Course Description:

Basics of Microbiology and Biochemistry; Introduction to Biochemical engineering, Mass and energy balance
in microbial processes; Microbial growth, Substrate utilization and product formation kinetics; Medium and
air sterilization; Enzyme kinetics and immobilized enzyme systems; Design of batch, continuous and fedbatch bioreactors; Transport Phenomena in biological reactors; Scale-up principles for biochemical processes;
Instrumentation and control of bioprocesses, Bio separations.

2. Scope and Objective of the C ourse:

The objective of the course, as implied by the course content above, is to introduce fundamental biochemical
engineering and bioprocess technology concepts and their commercial implications to the students from
chemical engineering. To accommodate those students who do not have the biological background, the
course will first introduce the basic concepts from microbiology, biochemistry, and the central dogma of
biology. Subsequently, the emphasis will be on the application of the principles of chemical engineering to
biological processes.
