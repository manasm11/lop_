FIRST/SECOND SEMESTER

In addition to part I (General Handout for all courses appended to the Time table) this portion
gives further specific details regarding the course.

Course No : BITS G540

Course Title : Research Practice
Instructor-in-C harge : Associate Dean, AGSRD
Instructor(s) : Supervisor(s)/M entor(s)

1. Aims and Objectives

This course is designed to train the students towards acquiring competence in research
methodologies. The course will be conducted in terms of actual participation in Research and
Development Work. Each student will be assigned to a faculty member to work on specified
projects. The student will be required to present a number of seminars in his research area in a
structured manner

2. Scope of the C ourse

The course broadly covers following aspects:

(i) Research proposal

(ii) Development related activities

(iii) Research related activities
The 25% weightage would be for the project proposal, which the student would be required to
write, based on the skills acquired. For developmental activities, which carry 25% weightage,
the supervisor would assign to the student working with him an appropriate developmental work,
which can be related to Centers/ Laboratories/ Assistance in course development or in the R&D
activities of the supervisor. The student would have the teaching/research skills by assisting the
Supervisor in teaching, evaluation and research activities of the supervisor. Under the research
related activities, which carries 50% weightage, a broad topic of research will be assigned to the
higher degree student by the Supervisor and the student would conduct literature search in the
specified area, learn various research methodologies/techniques for data collection and data
analysis, testing techniques/methods etc. and deliver seminars in his/her research area to the
supervisor. The student should also write research reports that along with the seminar/viva would
form part of evaluation component related to research related activities.

3. Operational Details

1. Within 2 weeks of registration, the student should prepare the work plan (research proposal)
for his research project and also for the developmental activities in consultation with the
supervisor.

2. Mid semester grading will be done by the supervisor based on the work done and progress
made towards planned objectives by the student in the assigned research area. The student is
required to submit mid semester report describing the work done and progress made by him. He
should also deliver a seminar to highlight these activities. Supervisors will grade the student for
mid semester on the basis of the mid semester report described above and the Seminar presented
by the student.

3. The student should submit mid-semester report in the 9"" week of the semester to the

Supervisor and this should be followed by seminar/presentation by the student. The supervisor in
tum is required to send mid-semester grades of all the students working with him to Head of
Department by the end of 9" week of the semester.

4. End semester report would provide details of work done by the student. End semester report
should be submitted to the supervisor and should be followed by seminar/presentation. Every
student would write a research proposal. This research proposal would form a part of the final
(end semester) report. The research proposal carries 25% weightage and should be written in the
proper format i.e. (i) Topic of Research (ii) Background and current status of research work in
the area as evident from the literature search/review, (iii) scope of the proposed research work,
(iv) methodology (v) work plan and time schedule (vi) references and bibliography. The
references and bibliography should be written in standard format and should be cited within the
text of the research proposal.
