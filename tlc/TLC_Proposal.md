## Project Summary:
A web-based Community Forum for BITSian students and professors. Every Student and Professor would have a unique profile. They can post, edit, update their relevant academic questions to be answered by the community. The discussions will be available for reference to other students as well. Students may create, save and share academic notes online. Further, the relevant questions on the forum could be saved as a ‘bookmark’ for future reference.

## Project Outcome
Every year, students face similar academic doubts. With students and professor asking and answering questions, a relevant FAQ would be created for the next batch of students. This will save a lot of time for students who earlier had to ask their seniors and individually mail professors for answering their queries. Further, it will provide deeper academic clarity to the students and hence help in improving learning outcomes. Students of all batches and teachers can also stay connected and share relevant findings in research and technology.

This will enhance mutual learning among students and professors. Also this will reduce communication gap between them as Professors could know the level of understanding by the doubts raised by the students. Also, students may get all the resources organized at one place.
