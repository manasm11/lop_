# Collaborative Software Development

[1. Collaborative Software Development with GitHub® Projects](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/330162832_Collaborative_Software_Development_with_GitHubR_Projects)

>Collaborative systems or groupware are computer-based systems that support groups of people engaged in a common task (or goal) that provide an interface to a shared environment

* The code hosting and collaborative development platform GitHub® provides an interface and a workflow that takes up common problems in the collaborative development process
* In this paper we examine this workflow from a theoretical point of view and discuss possible problems of collaboration.

### Need

1. growing need for interpersonal communication
2. and rules of physically detached teams in today’s projects

#### Motivation

* number of individuals involved in a software project large.
* these individuals -> from different continents and time zones and use different languages.

>**3 C's** -
Communication,
Collaboration and
Coordination

#### Introduction

Research is primarily focused on

* observing how software developers coordinate their work
* building theories based on these observations.
* several tools to support collaboration have been proposed and partially evaluated
